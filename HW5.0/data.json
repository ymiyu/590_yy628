{"x": ["A weary journey beyond the last scrub timber and straggling copses, into the heart of the Barrens where the niggard North is supposed to deny the Earth, are to be found great sweeps of forests and stretches of smiling land. But this the world is just beginning to know. The world's explorers have known it, from time to time, but hitherto they have never returned to tell the world.", "The Barrens--well, they are the Barrens, the bad lands of the Arctic, the deserts of the Circle, the bleak and bitter home of the musk-ox and the lean plains wolf. So Avery Van Brunt found them, treeless and cheerless, sparsely clothed with moss and lichens, and altogether uninviting. At least so he found them till he penetrated to the white blank spaces on the map, and came upon undreamed-of rich spruce forests and unrecorded Eskimo tribes. It had been his intention, (and his bid for fame), to break up these white blank spaces and diversify them with the black markings of mountain-chains, sinks and basins, and sinuous river courses; and it was with added delight that he came to speculate upon the possibilities of timber belts and native villages.", "Avery Van Brunt, or, in full distinction, Professor A. Van Brunt of the Geological Survey, was second in command of the expedition, and first in command of the sub-expedition which he had led on a side tour of some half a thousand miles up one of the branches of the Thelon and which he was now leading into one of his unrecorded villages. At his back plodded eight men, two of them French-Canadian _voyageurs_, and the remainder strapping Crees from Manitoba-way. He, alone, was full-blooded Saxon, and his blood was pounding fiercely through his veins to the traditions of his race. Clive and Hastings, Drake and Raleigh, Hengest and Horsa, walked with him. First of all men of his breed was he to enter this lone Northland village, and at the thought an exultancy came upon him, an exaltation, and his followers noted that his leg-weariness fell from him and that he insensibly quickened the pace.", "The village emptied itself, and a motley crowd trooped out to meet him, men in the forefront, with bows and spears clutched menacingly, and women and children faltering timidly in the rear. Van Brunt lifted his right arm and made the universal peace sign, a sign which all peoples know, and the villagers answered in peace. But to his chagrin, a skin-clad man ran forward and thrust out his hand with a familiar \"Hello.\" He was a bearded man, with cheeks and brow bronzed to copper-brown, and in him Van Brunt knew his kind.", "\"Let them camp alongside of me,\" he answered Van Brunt's glance at his party. \"Old Tantlatch will take care of them. Come on.\"", "He swung off in a long stride, Van Brunt following at his heels through the village. In irregular fashion, wherever the ground favored, the lodges of moose hide were pitched. Van Brunt ran his practised eye over them and calculated.", "The man nodded. \"Pretty close to it. But here's where I live, out of the thick of it, you know--more privacy and all that. Sit down. I'll eat with you when your men get something cooked up. I've forgotten what tea tastes like.... Five years and never a taste or smell.... Any tobacco?... Ah, thanks, and a pipe? Good. Now for a fire-stick and we'll see if the weed has lost its cunning.\"", "He scratched the match with the painstaking care of the woodsman, cherished its young flame as though there were never another in all the world, and drew in the first mouthful of smoke. This he retained meditatively for a time, and blew out through his pursed lips slowly and caressingly. Then his face seemed to soften as he leaned back, and a soft blur to film his eyes. He sighed heavily, happily, with immeasurable content, and then said suddenly:", "\"Five years.\" The man sighed again. \"And you, I presume, wish to know about it, being naturally curious, and this a sufficiently strange situation, and all that. But it's not much. I came in from Edmonton after musk-ox, and like Pike and the rest of them, had my mischances, only I lost my party and outfit. Starvation, hardship, the regular tale, you know, sole survivor and all that, till I crawled into Tantlatch's, here, on hand and knee.\"", "Fairfax settled back again and resumed his smoke-spirals. \"I am glad to hear it,\" he remarked reflectively. \"Prevanche was a bully fellow if he _did_ have ideas about head-straps, the beggar. And he pulled through? Well, I'm glad.\"", "Five years ... the phrase drifted recurrently through Van Brunt's thought, and somehow the face of Emily Southwaithe seemed to rise up and take form before him. Five years ... A wedge of wild-fowl honked low overhead and at sight of the encampment veered swiftly to the north into the smouldering sun. Van Brunt could not follow them. He pulled out his watch. It was an hour past midnight. The northward clouds flushed bloodily, and rays of sombre-red shot southward, firing the gloomy woods with a lurid radiance. The air was in breathless calm, not a needle quivered, and the least sounds of the camp were distinct and clear as trumpet calls. The Crees and _voyageurs_ felt the spirit of it and mumbled in dreamy undertones, and the cook unconsciously subdued the clatter of pot and pan. Somewhere a child was crying, and from the depths of the forest, like a silver thread, rose a woman's voice in mournful chant:", "\"Partly disinclination, I suppose, and partly because of circumstances over which I had no control. You see, Tantlatch, here, was down with a broken leg when I made his acquaintance,--a nasty fracture,--and I set it for him and got him into shape. I stayed some time, getting my strength back. I was the first white man he had seen, and of course I seemed very wise and showed his people no end of things. Coached them up in military tactics, among other things, so that they conquered the four other tribal villages, (which you have not yet seen), and came to rule the land. And they naturally grew to think a good deal of me, so much so that when I was ready to go they wouldn't hear of it. Were most hospitable, in fact. Put a couple of guards over me and watched me day and night. And then Tantlatch offered me inducements,--in a sense, inducements,--so to say, and as it didn't matter much one way or the other, I reconciled myself to remaining.\"", "Fairfax reached forward impulsively and shook his hand. \"You were Billy's friend, eh? Poor Billy! He spoke of you often.\"", "\"Rum meeting place, though,\" he added, casting an embracing glance over the primordial landscape and listening for a moment to the woman's mournful notes. \"Her man was clawed by a bear, and she's taking it hard.\"", "\"Beastly life!\" Van Brunt grimaced his disgust. \"I suppose, after five years of it, civilization will be sweet? What do you say?\"", "Fairfax's face took on a stolid expression. \"Oh, I don't know. At least they're honest folk and live according to their lights. And then they are amazingly simple. No complexity about them, no thousand and one subtle ramifications to every single emotion they experience. They love, fear, hate, are angered, or made happy, in common, ordinary, and unmistakable terms. It may be a beastly life, but at least it is easy to live. No philandering, no dallying. If a woman likes you, she'll not be backward in telling you so. If she hates you, she'll tell you so, and then, if you feel inclined, you can beat her, but the thing is, she knows precisely what you mean, and you know precisely what she means. No mistakes, no misunderstandings. It has its charm, after civilization's fitful fever. Comprehend?\"", "\"No, it's a pretty good life,\" he continued, after a pause; \"good enough for me, and I intend to stay with it.\"", "Van Brunt lowered his head in a musing manner, and an imperceptible smile played on his mouth. No philandering, no dallying, no misunderstanding. Fairfax also was taking it hard, he thought, just because Emily Southwaithe had been mistakenly clawed by a bear. And not a bad sort of a bear, either, was Carlton Southwaithe.", "\"Life's too easy here, I tell you.\" Fairfax spoke with decision. \"I understand everything, and I am understood. Summer and winter alternate like the sun flashing through the palings of a fence, the seasons are a blur of light and shade, and time slips by, and life slips by, and then ... a wailing in the forest, and the dark. Listen!\"", "He held up his hand, and the silver thread of the woman's sorrow rose through the silence and the calm. Fairfax joined in softly.", "\"O-o-o-o-o-o-a-haa-ha-a-ha-aa-a-a, O-o-o-o-o-o-a-ha-a-ha-a,\" he sang. \"Can't you hear it? Can't you see it? The women mourning? the funeral chant? my hair white-locked and patriarchal? my skins wrapped in rude splendor about me? my hunting-spear by my side? And who shall say it is not well?\"", "Van Brunt looked at him coolly. \"Fairfax, you are a damned fool. Five years of this is enough to knock any man, and you are in an unhealthy, morbid condition. Further, Carlton Southwaithe is dead.\"", "Van Brunt filled his pipe and lighted it, the while watching slyly and with almost professional interest. Fairfax's eyes flashed on the instant, his fists clenched, he half rose up, then his muscles relaxed and he seemed to brood. Michael, the cook, signalled that the meal was ready, but Van Brunt motioned back to delay. The silence hung heavy, and he fell to analyzing the forest scents, the odors of mould and rotting vegetation, the resiny smells of pine cones and needles, the aromatic savors of many camp-smokes. Twice Fairfax looked up, but said nothing, and then:", "Another long silence settled down, to be broken by Fairfax finally with a na\u00efve smile. \"I guess you're right, Van Brunt. I'll go along.\"", "\"I knew you would.\" Van Brunt laid his hand on Fairfax's shoulder. \"Of course, one cannot know, but I imagine--for one in her position--she has had offers--\"", "After supper, when the Crees and _voyageurs_ had rolled into their blankets, snoring, the two men lingered by the dying fire. There was much to talk about,--wars and politics and explorations, the doings of men and the happening of things, mutual friends, marriages, deaths,--five years of history for which Fairfax clamored.", "\"So the Spanish fleet was bottled up in Santiago,\" Van Brunt was saying, when a young woman stepped lightly before him and stood by Fairfax's side. She looked swiftly into his face, then turned a troubled gaze upon Van Brunt.", "\"Chief Tantlatch's daughter, sort of princess,\" Fairfax explained, with an honest flush. \"One of the inducements, in short, to make me stay. Thom, this is Van Brunt, friend of mine.\"", "Van Brunt held out his hand, but the woman maintained a rigid repose quite in keeping with her general appearance. Not a line of her face softened, not a feature unbent. She looked him straight in the eyes, her own piercing, questioning, searching.", "\"Precious lot she understands,\" Fairfax laughed. \"Her first introduction, you know. But as you were saying, with the Spanish fleet bottled up in Santiago?\"", "Thom crouched down by her husband's side, motionless as a bronze statue, only her eyes flashing from face to face in ceaseless search. And Avery Van Brunt, as he talked on and on, felt a nervousness under the dumb gaze. In the midst of his most graphic battle descriptions, he would become suddenly conscious of the black eyes burning into him, and would stumble and flounder till he could catch the gait and go again. Fairfax, hands clasped round knees, pipe out, absorbed, spurred him on when he lagged, and repictured the world he thought he had forgotten.", "One hour passed, and two, and Fairfax rose reluctantly to his feet. \"And Cronje was cornered, eh? Well, just wait a moment till I run over to Tantlatch. He'll be expecting you, and I'll arrange for you to see him after breakfast. That will be all right, won't it?\"", "He went off between the pines, and Van Brunt found himself staring into Thom's warm eyes. Five years, he mused, and she can't be more than twenty now. A most remarkable creature. Being Eskimo, she should have a little flat excuse for a nose, and lo, it is neither broad nor flat, but aquiline, with nostrils delicately and sensitively formed as any fine lady's of a whiter breed--the Indian strain somewhere, be assured, Avery Van Brunt. And, Avery Van Brunt, don't be nervous, she won't eat you; she's only a woman, and not a bad-looking one at that. Oriental rather than aborigine. Eyes large and fairly wide apart, with just the faintest hint of Mongol obliquity. Thom, you're an anomaly. You're out of place here among these Eskimos, even if your father is one. Where did your mother come from? or your grandmother? And Thom, my dear, you're a beauty, a frigid, frozen little beauty with Alaskan lava in your blood, and please don't look at me that way.", "He laughed and stood up. Her insistent stare disconcerted him. A dog was prowling among the grub-sacks. He would drive it away and place them into safety against Fairfax's return. But Thom stretched out a detaining hand and stood up, facing him.", "And the swift expression of her face demanded all for which \"you\" stood, his reason for existence, his presence there, his relation to her husband--everything.", "\"Brother,\" he answered in the same tongue, with a sweeping gesture to the south. \"Brothers we be, your man and I.\"", "Van Brunt shrugged his shoulders. He was aware of a certain secret shame, of an impersonal sort of shame, and an anger against Fairfax. And he felt the warm blood in his face as he regarded the young savage. She was just a woman. That was all--a woman. The whole sordid story over again, over and over again, as old as Eve and young as the last new love-light.", "\"My man! My man! My man!\" she was reiterating vehemently, her face passionately dark, and the ruthless tenderness of the Eternal Woman, the Mate-Woman, looking out at him from her eyes.", "\"Thom,\" he said gravely, in English, \"you were born in the Northland forest, and you have eaten fish and meat, and fought with frost and famine, and lived simply all the days of your life. And there are many things, indeed not simple, which you do not know and cannot come to understand. You do not know what it is to long for the fleshpots afar, you cannot understand what it is to yearn for a fair woman's face. And the woman is fair, Thom, the woman is nobly fair. You have been woman to this man, and you have been your all, but your all is very little, very simple. Too little and too simple, and he is an alien man. Him you have never known, you can never know. It is so ordained. You held him in your arms, but you never held his heart, this man with his blurring seasons and his dreams of a barbaric end. Dreams and dream-dust, that is what he has been to you. You clutched at form and gripped shadow, gave yourself to a man and bedded with the wraith of a man. In such manner, of old, did the daughters of men whom the gods found fair. And, Thom, Thom, I should not like to be John Fairfax in the night-watches of the years to come, in the night-watches, when his eyes shall see, not the sun-gloried hair of the woman by his side, but the dark tresses of a mate forsaken in the forests of the North.\"", "Though she did not understand, she had listened with intense attention, as though life hung on his speech. But she caught at her husband's name and cried out in Eskimo:--", "But she could not understand his English tongue, and deemed that she was being trifled with. The dumb, insensate anger of the Mate-Woman flamed in her face, and it almost seemed to the man as though she crouched panther-like for the spring.", "He cursed softly to himself and watched the fire fade from her face and the soft luminous glow of the appealing woman spring up, of the appealing woman who foregoes strength and panoplies herself wisely in her weakness.", "\"He is my man,\" she said gently. \"Never have I known other. It cannot be that I should ever know other. Nor can it be that he should go from me.\"", "\"It is for thee to say he shall not go from me,\" she answered softly, a half-sob in her throat.", "\"It is for thee to say. He is my man. Before all women he is my man. Thou art big, thou art strong, and behold, I am very weak. See, I am at thy feet. It is for thee to deal with me. It is for thee.\"", "\"Get up!\" He jerked her roughly erect and stood up himself. \"Thou art a woman. Wherefore the dirt is no place for thee, nor the feet of any man.\"", "\"My father is Chief Tantlatch. He is a power over five villages. I will see that the five villages be searched for thy choice of all maidens, that thou mayest stay here by thy brother, and dwell in comfort.\"", "As the day is quenched by a sea of fog, so his song smote the light out of her face. \"It is the tongue of his own people,\" she said; \"the tongue of his own people.\"", "Thom raised the skin-flap of her father's lodge. Two men sat with him, and the three looked at her with swift interest. But her face betokened nothing as she entered and took seat quietly, without speech. Tantlatch drummed with his knuckles on a spear-heft across his knees, and gazed idly along the path of a sun-ray which pierced a lacing-hole and flung a glittering track across the murky atmosphere of the lodge. To his right, at his shoulder, crouched Chugungatte, the shaman. Both were old men, and the weariness of many years brooded in their eyes. But opposite them sat Keen, a young man and chief favorite in the tribe. He was quick and alert of movement, and his black eyes flashed from face to face in ceaseless scrutiny and challenge.", "Silence reigned in the place. Now and again camp noises penetrated, and from the distance, faint and far, like the shadows of voices, came the wrangling of boys in thin shrill tones. A dog thrust his head into the entrance and blinked wolfishly at them for a space, the slaver dripping from his ivory-white fangs. After a time he growled tentatively, and then, awed by the immobility of the human figures, lowered his head and grovelled away backward. Tantlatch glanced apathetically at his daughter.", "\"Nay, but there is a new look on his face, a new light in his eyes, and with the New-Comer he sits by the fire, and they talk and talk, and the talk is without end.\"", "\"There be something calling him from afar,\" she went on, \"and he seems to sit and listen, and to answer, singing, in his own people's tongue.\"", "Again Chugungatte whispered and Keen leaned forward, and Thom held her speech till her father nodded his head that she might proceed.", "\"It be known to thee, O Tantlatch, that the wild goose and the swan and the little ringed duck be born here in the low-lying lands. It be known that they go away before the face of the frost to unknown places. And it be known, likewise, that always do they return when the sun is in the land and the waterways are free. Always do they return to where they were born, that new life may go forth. The land calls to them and they come. And now there is another land that calls, and it is calling to my man,--the land where he was born,--and he hath it in mind to answer the call. Yet is he my man. Before all women is he my man.\"", "\"Ay, it is well!\" Keen cried boldly. \"The land calls to its children, and all lands call their children home again. As the wild goose and the swan and the little ringed duck are called, so is called this Stranger Man who has lingered with us and who now must go. Also there be the call of kind. The goose mates with the goose, nor does the swan mate with the little ringed duck. It is not well that the swan should mate with the little ringed duck. Nor is it well that stranger men should mate with the women of our villages. Wherefore I say the man should go, to his own kind, in his own land.\"", "\"Ay, he is a great man.\" Chugungatte lifted his head with a faint recrudescence of youthful vigor. \"He is a great man, and he put strength in thy arm, O Tantlatch, and gave thee power, and made thy name to be feared in the land, to be feared and to be respected. He is very wise, and there be much profit in his wisdom. To him are we beholden for many things,--for the cunning in war and the secrets of the defence of a village and a rush in the forest, for the discussion in council and the undoing of enemies by word of mouth and the hard-sworn promise, for the gathering of game and the making of traps and the preserving of food, for the curing of sickness and mending of hurts of trail and fight. Thou, Tantlatch, wert a lame old man this day, were it not that the Stranger Man came into our midst and attended on thee. And ever, when in doubt on strange questions, have we gone to him, that out of his wisdom he might make things clear, and ever has he made things clear. And there be questions yet to arise, and needs upon his wisdom yet to come, and we cannot bear to let him go. It is not well that we should let him go.\"", "Tantlatch continued to drum on the spear-haft, and gave no sign that he had heard. Thom studied his face in vain, and Chugungatte seemed to shrink together and droop down as the weight of years descended upon him again.", "\"No man makes my kill.\" Keen smote his breast a valorous blow. \"I make my own kill. I am glad to live when I make my own kill. When I creep through the snow upon the great moose, I am glad. And when I draw the bow, so, with my full strength, and drive the arrow fierce and swift and to the heart, I am glad. And the meat of no man's kill tastes as sweet as the meat of my kill. I am glad to live, glad in my own cunning and strength, glad that I am a doer of things, a doer of things for myself. Of what other reason to live than that? Why should I live if I delight not in myself and the things I do? And it is because I delight and am glad that I go forth to hunt and fish, and it is because I go forth to hunt and fish that I grow cunning and strong. The man who stays in the lodge by the fire grows not cunning and strong. He is not made happy in the eating of my kill, nor is living to him a delight. He does not live. And so I say it is well this Stranger Man should go. His wisdom does not make us wise. If he be cunning, there is no need that we be cunning. If need arise, we go to him for his cunning. We eat the meat of his kill, and it tastes unsweet. We merit by his strength, and in it there is no delight. We do not live when he does our living for us. We grow fat and like women, and we are afraid to work, and we forget how to do things for ourselves. Let the man go, O Tantlatch, that we may be men! I am Keen, a man, and I make my own kill!\"", "Tantlatch turned a gaze upon him in which seemed the vacancy of eternity. Keen waited the decision expectantly; but the lips did not move, and the old chief turned toward his daughter.", "\"That which be given cannot be taken away,\" she burst forth. \"I was but a girl when this Stranger Man, who is my man, came among us. And I knew not men, or the ways of men, and my heart was in the play of girls, when thou, Tantlatch, thou and none other, didst call me to thee and press me into the arms of the Stranger Man. Thou and none other, Tantlatch; and as thou didst give me to the man, so didst thou give the man to me. He is my man. In my arms has he slept, and from my arms he cannot be taken.\"", "\"It were well, O Tantlatch,\" Keen followed quickly, with a significant glance at Thom, \"it were well to remember that that which be given cannot be taken away.\"", "Chugungatte straightened up. \"Out of thy youth, Keen, come the words of thy mouth. As for ourselves, O Tantlatch, we be old men and we understand. We, too, have looked into the eyes of women and felt our blood go hot with strange desires. But the years have chilled us, and we have learned the wisdom of the council, the shrewdness of the cool head and hand, and we know that the warm heart be over-warm and prone to rashness. We know that Keen found favor in thy eyes. We know that Thom was promised him in the old days when she was yet a child. And we know that the new days came, and the Stranger Man, and that out of our wisdom and desire for welfare was Thom lost to Keen and the promise broken.\"", "\"Nor have I taken other woman to my bed,\" Keen broke in. \"And I have builded my own fire, and cooked my own food, and ground my teeth in my loneliness.\"", "Chugungatte waved his hand that he had not finished. \"I am an old man and I speak from understanding. It be good to be strong and grasp for power. It be better to forego power that good come out of it. In the old days I sat at thy shoulder, Tantlatch, and my voice was heard over all in the council, and my advice taken in affairs of moment. And I was strong and held power. Under Tantlatch I was the greatest man. Then came the Stranger Man, and I saw that he was cunning and wise and great. And in that he was wiser and greater than I, it was plain that greater profit should arise from him than from me. And I had thy ear, Tantlatch, and thou didst listen to my words, and the Stranger Man was given power and place and thy daughter, Thom. And the tribe prospered under the new laws in the new days, and so shall it continue to prosper with the Stranger Man in our midst. We be old men, we two, O Tantlatch, thou and I, and this be an affair of head, not heart. Hear my words, Tantlatch! Hear my words! The man remains!\"", "There was a long silence. The old chief pondered with the massive certitude of God, and Chugungatte seemed to wrap himself in the mists of a great antiquity. Keen looked with yearning upon the woman, and she, unnoting, held her eyes steadfastly upon her father's face. The wolf-dog shoved the flap aside again, and plucking courage at the quiet, wormed forward on his belly. He sniffed curiously at Thom's listless hand, cocked ears challengingly at Chugungatte, and hunched down upon his haunches before Tantlatch. The spear rattled to the ground, and the dog, with a frightened yell, sprang sideways, snapping in mid-air, and on the second leap cleared the entrance.", "Tantlatch looked from face to face, pondering each one long and carefully. Then he raised his head, with rude royalty, and gave judgment in cold and even tones: \"The man remains. Let the hunters be called together. Send a runner to the next village with word to bring on the fighting men. I shall not see the New-Comer. Do thou, Chugungatte, have talk with him. Tell him he may go at once, if he would go in peace. And if fight there be, kill, kill, kill, to the last man; but let my word go forth that no harm befall our man,--the man whom my daughter hath wedded. It is well.\"", "Chugungatte rose and tottered out; Thom followed; but as Keen stooped to the entrance the voice of Tantlatch stopped him.", "Because of Fairfax's instructions in the art of war, the tribesmen did not hurl themselves forward boldly and with clamor. Instead, there was great restraint and self-control, and they were content to advance silently, creeping and crawling from shelter to shelter. By the river bank, and partly protected by a narrow open space, crouched the Crees and _voyageurs_. Their eyes could see nothing, and only in vague ways did their ears hear, but they felt the thrill of life which ran through the forest, the indistinct, indefinable movement of an advancing host.", "Avery Van Brunt laughed, knocked the ashes out of his pipe, and put it carefully away with the pouch, and loosened the hunting-knife in its sheath at his hip.", "Van Brunt saw a head peer from behind a distant tree, and with a quick shot sent the man sprawling to the ground in a death struggle. Michael potted a third, and Fairfax and the rest took a hand, firing at every exposure and into each clump of agitated brush. In crossing one little swale out of cover, five of the tribesmen remained on their faces, and to the left, where the covering was sparse, a dozen men were struck. But they took the punishment with sullen steadiness, coming on cautiously, deliberately, without haste and without lagging.", "Ten minutes later, when they were quite close, all movement was suspended, the advance ceased abruptly, and the quietness that followed was portentous, threatening. Only could be seen the green and gold of the woods, and undergrowth, shivering and trembling to the first faint puffs of the day-wind. The wan white morning sun mottled the earth with long shadows and streaks of light. A wounded man lifted his head and crawled painfully out of the swale, Michael following him with his rifle but forbearing to shoot. A whistle ran along the invisible line from left to right, and a flight of arrows arched through the air.", "They broke cover simultaneously. The forest heaved into sudden life. A great yell went up, and the rifles barked back sharp defiance. Tribesmen knew their deaths in mid-leap, and as they fell, their brothers surged over them in a roaring, irresistible wave. In the forefront of the rush, hair flying and arms swinging free, flashing past the tree-trunks, and leaping the obstructing logs, came Thom. Fairfax sighted on her and almost pulled trigger ere he knew her.", "The Crees never heard, nor Michael and his brother _voyageur_, nor Van Brunt, who was keeping one shell continuously in the air. But Thom bore straight on, unharmed, at the heels of a skin-clad hunter who had veered in before her from the side. Fairfax emptied his magazine into the men to right and left of her, and swung his rifle to meet the big hunter. But the man, seeming to recognize him, swerved suddenly aside and plunged his spear into the body of Michael. On the moment Thom had one arm passed around her husband's neck, and twisting half about, with voice and gesture was splitting the mass of charging warriors. A score of men hurled past on either side, and Fairfax, for a brief instant's space, stood looking upon her and her bronze beauty, thrilling, exulting, stirred to unknown deeps, visioning strange things, dreaming, immortally dreaming. Snatches and scraps of old-world philosophies and new-world ethics floated through his mind, and things wonderfully concrete and woefully incongruous--hunting scenes, stretches of sombre forest, vastnesses of silent snow, the glittering of ballroom lights, great galleries and lecture halls, a fleeting shimmer of glistening test-tubes, long rows of book-lined shelves, the throb of machinery and the roar of traffic, a fragment of forgotten song, faces of dear women and old chums, a lonely watercourse amid upstanding peaks, a shattered boat on a pebbly strand, quiet moonlit fields, fat vales, the smell of hay....", "A hunter, struck between the eyes with a rifle-ball, pitched forward lifeless, and with the momentum of his charge slid along the ground. Fairfax came back to himself. His comrades, those that lived, had been swept far back among the trees beyond. He could hear the fierce \"Hia! Hia!\" of the hunters as they closed in and cut and thrust with their weapons of bone and ivory. The cries of the stricken men smote him like blows. He knew the fight was over, the cause was lost, but all his race traditions and race loyalty impelled him into the welter that he might die at least with his kind.", "She held him close around the neck and twined her limbs about his till he tripped and stumbled, reeled violently to recover footing, tripped again, and fell backward to the ground. His head struck a jutting root, and he was half-stunned and could struggle but feebly. In the fall she had heard the feathered swish of an arrow darting past, and she covered his body with hers, as with a shield, her arms holding him tightly, her face and lips pressed upon his neck.", "Then it was that Keen rose up from a tangled thicket a score of feet away. He looked about him with care. The fight had swept on and the cry of the last man was dying away. There was no one to see. He fitted an arrow to the string and glanced at the man and woman. Between her breast and arm the flesh of the man's side showed white. Keen bent the bow and drew back the arrow to its head. Twice he did so, calmly and for certainty, and then drove the bone-barbed missile straight home to the white flesh, gleaming yet more white in the dark-armed, dark-breasted embrace.", "Old Koskoosh listened greedily. Though his sight had long since faded, his hearing was still acute, and the slightest sound penetrated to the glimmering intelligence which yet abode behind the withered forehead, but which no longer gazed forth upon the things of the world. Ah! that was Sit-cum-to-ha, shrilly anathematizing the dogs as she cuffed and beat them into the harnesses. Sit-cum-to-ha was his daughter's daughter, but she was too busy to waste a thought upon her broken grandfather, sitting alone there in the snow, forlorn and helpless. Camp must be broken. The long trail waited while the short day refused to linger. Life called her, and the duties of life, not death. And he was very close to death now.", "The thought made the old man panicky for the moment, and he stretched forth a palsied hand which wandered tremblingly over the small heap of dry wood beside him. Reassured that it was indeed there, his hand returned to the shelter of his mangy furs, and he again fell to listening. The sulky crackling of half-frozen hides told him that the chief's moose-skin lodge had been struck, and even then was being rammed and jammed into portable compass. The chief was his son, stalwart and strong, head man of the tribesmen, and a mighty hunter. As the women toiled with the camp luggage, his voice rose, chiding them for their slowness. Old Koskoosh strained his ears. It was the last time he would hear that voice. There went Geehow's lodge! And Tusken's! Seven, eight, nine; only the shaman's could be still standing. There! They were at work upon it now. He could hear the shaman grunt as he piled it on the sled. A child whimpered, and a woman soothed it with soft, crooning gutturals. Little Koo-tee, the old man thought, a fretful child, and not overstrong. It would die soon, perhaps, and they would burn a hole through the frozen tundra and pile rocks above to keep the wolverines away. Well, what did it matter? A few years at best, and as many an empty belly as a full one. And in the end, Death waited, ever-hungry and hungriest of them all.", "What was that? Oh, the men lashing the sleds and drawing tight the thongs. He listened, who would listen no more. The whip-lashes snarled and bit among the dogs. Hear them whine! How they hated the work and the trail! They were off! Sled after sled churned slowly away into the silence. They were gone. They had passed out of his life, and he faced the last bitter hour alone. No. The snow crunched beneath a moccasin; a man stood beside him; upon his head a hand rested gently. His son was good to do this thing. He remembered other old men whose sons had not waited after the tribe. But his son had. He wandered away into the past, till the young man's voice brought him back.", "\"There be wood beside you,\" the younger man continued, \"and the fire burns bright. The morning is gray, and the cold has broken. It will snow presently. Even now is it snowing.\"", "\"The tribesmen hurry. Their bales are heavy, and their bellies flat with lack of feasting. The trail is long and they travel fast. I go now. It is well?\"", "\"It is well. I am as a last year's leaf, clinging lightly to the stem. The first breath that blows, and I fall. My voice is become like an old woman's. My eyes no longer show me the way of my feet, and my feet are heavy, and I am tired. It is well.\"", "He bowed his head in content till the last noise of the complaining snow had died away, and he knew his son was beyond recall. Then his hand crept out in haste to the wood. It alone stood between him and the eternity that yawned in upon him. At last the measure of his life was a handful of fagots. One by one they would go to feed the fire, and just so, step by step, death would creep upon him. When the last stick had surrendered up its heat, the frost would begin to gather strength. First his feet would yield, then his hands; and the numbness would travel, slowly, from the extremities to the body. His head would fall forward upon his knees, and he would rest. It was easy. All men must die.", "He did not complain. It was the way of life, and it was just. He had been born close to the earth, close to the earth had he lived, and the law thereof was not new to him. It was the law of all flesh. Nature was not kindly to the flesh. She had no concern for that concrete thing called the individual. Her interest lay in the species, the race. This was the deepest abstraction old Koskoosh's barbaric mind was capable of, but he grasped it firmly. He saw it exemplified in all life. The rise of the sap, the bursting greenness of the willow bud, the fall of the yellow leaf--in this alone was told the whole history. But one task did Nature set the individual. Did he not perform it, he died. Did he perform it, it was all the same, he died. Nature did not care; there were plenty who were obedient, and it was only the obedience in this matter, not the obedient, which lived and lived always. The tribe of Koskoosh was very old. The old men he had known when a boy, had known old men before them. Therefore it was true that the tribe lived, that it stood for the obedience of all its members, way down into the forgotten past, whose very resting-places were unremembered. They did not count; they were episodes. They had passed away like clouds from a summer sky. He also was an episode, and would pass away. Nature did not care. To life she set one task, gave one law. To perpetuate was the task of life, its law was death. A maiden was a good creature to look upon, full-breasted and strong, with spring to her step and light in her eyes. But her task was yet before her. The light in her eyes brightened, her step quickened, she was now bold with the young men, now timid, and she gave them of her own unrest. And ever she grew fairer and yet fairer to look upon, till some hunter, able no longer to withhold himself, took her to his lodge to cook and toil for him and to become the mother of his children. And with the coming of her offspring her looks left her. Her limbs dragged and shuffled, her eyes dimmed and bleared, and only the little children found joy against the withered cheek of the old squaw by the fire. Her task was done. But a little while, on the first pinch of famine or the first long trail, and she would be left, even as he had been left, in the snow, with a little pile of wood. Such was the law.", "He placed a stick carefully upon the fire and resumed his meditations. It was the same everywhere, with all things. The mosquitoes vanished with the first frost. The little tree-squirrel crawled away to die. When age settled upon the rabbit it became slow and heavy, and could no longer outfoot its enemies. Even the big bald-face grew clumsy and blind and quarrelsome, in the end to be dragged down by a handful of yelping huskies. He remembered how he had abandoned his own father on an upper reach of the Klondike one winter, the winter before the missionary came with his talk-books and his box of medicines. Many a time had Koskoosh smacked his lips over the recollection of that box, though now his mouth refused to moisten. The \"painkiller\" had been especially good. But the missionary was a bother after all, for he brought no meat into the camp, and he ate heartily, and the hunters grumbled. But he chilled his lungs on the divide by the Mayo, and the dogs afterwards nosed the stones away and fought over his bones.", "Koskoosh placed another stick on the fire and harked back deeper into the past. There was the time of the Great Famine, when the old men crouched empty-bellied to the fire, and let fall from their lips dim traditions of the ancient day when the Yukon ran wide open for three winters, and then lay frozen for three summers. He had lost his mother in that famine. In the summer the salmon run had failed, and the tribe looked forward to the winter and the coming of the caribou. Then the winter came, but with it there were no caribou. Never had the like been known, not even in the lives of the old men. But the caribou did not come, and it was the seventh year, and the rabbits had not replenished, and the dogs were naught but bundles of bones. And through the long darkness the children wailed and died, and the women, and the old men; and not one in ten of the tribe lived to meet the sun when it came back in the spring. That _was_ a famine!", "But he had seen times of plenty, too, when the meat spoiled on their hands, and the dogs were fat and worthless with overeating--times when they let the game go unkilled, and the women were fertile, and the lodges were cluttered with sprawling men-children and women-children. Then it was the men became high-stomached, and revived ancient quarrels, and crossed the divides to the south to kill the Pellys, and to the west that they might sit by the dead fires of the Tananas. He remembered, when a boy, during a time of plenty, when he saw a moose pulled down by the wolves. Zing-ha lay with him in the snow and watched--Zing-ha, who later became the craftiest of hunters, and who, in the end, fell through an air-hole on the Yukon. They found him, a month afterward, just as he had crawled halfway out and frozen stiff to the ice.", "But the moose. Zing-ha and he had gone out that day to play at hunting after the manner of their fathers. On the bed of the creek they struck the fresh track of a moose, and with it the tracks of many wolves. \"An old one,\" Zing-ha, who was quicker at reading the sign, said--\"an old one who cannot keep up with the herd. The wolves have cut him out from his brothers, and they will never leave him.\" And it was so. It was their way. By day and by night, never resting, snarling on his heels, snapping at his nose, they would stay by him to the end. How Zing-ha and he felt the blood-lust quicken! The finish would be a sight to see!", "Eager-footed, they took the trail, and even he, Koskoosh, slow of sight and an unversed tracker, could have followed it blind, it was so wide. Hot were they on the heels of the chase, reading the grim tragedy, fresh-written, at every step. Now they came to where the moose had made a stand. Thrice the length of a grown man's body, in every direction, had the snow been stamped about and uptossed. In the midst were the deep impressions of the splay-hoofed game, and all about, everywhere, were the lighter footmarks of the wolves. Some, while their brothers harried the kill, had lain to one side and rested. The full-stretched impress of their bodies in the snow was as perfect as though made the moment before. One wolf had been caught in a wild lunge of the maddened victim and trampled to death. A few bones, well picked, bore witness.", "Again, they ceased the uplift of their snowshoes at a second stand. Here the great animal had fought desperately. Twice had he been dragged down, as the snow attested, and twice had he shaken his assailants clear and gained footing once more. He had done his task long since, but none the less was life dear to him. Zing-ha said it was a strange thing, a moose once down to get free again; but this one certainly had. The shaman would see signs and wonders in this when they told him.", "And yet again, they come to where the moose had made to mount the bank and gain the timber. But his foes had laid on from behind, till he reared and fell back upon them, crushing two deep into the snow. It was plain the kill was at hand, for their brothers had left them untouched. Two more stands were hurried past, brief in time-length and very close together. The trail was red now, and the clean stride of the great beast had grown short and slovenly. Then they heard the first sounds of the battle--not the full-throated chorus of the chase, but the short, snappy bark which spoke of close quarters and teeth to flesh. Crawling up the wind, Zing-ha bellied it through the snow, and with him crept he, Koskoosh, who was to be chief of the tribesmen in the years to come. Together they shoved aside the under branches of a young spruce and peered forth. It was the end they saw.", "The picture, like all of youth's impressions, was still strong with him, and his dim eyes watched the end played out as vividly as in that far-off time. Koskoosh marvelled at this, for in the days which followed, when he was a leader of men and a head of councillors, he had done great deeds and made his name a curse in the mouths of the Pellys, to say naught of the strange white man he had killed, knife to knife, in open fight.", "For long he pondered on the days of his youth, till the fire died down and the frost bit deeper. He replenished it with two sticks this time, and gauged his grip on life by what remained. If Sit-cum-to-ha had only remembered her grandfather, and gathered a larger armful, his hours would have been longer. It would have been easy. But she was ever a careless child, and honored not her ancestors from the time the Beaver, son of the son of Zing-ha, first cast eyes upon her. Well, what mattered it? Had he not done likewise in his own quick youth? For a while he listened to the silence. Perhaps the heart of his son might soften, and he would come back with the dogs to take his old father on with the tribe to where the caribou ran thick and the fat hung heavy upon them.", "He strained his ears, his restless brain for the moment stilled. Not a stir, nothing. He alone took breath in the midst of the great silence. It was very lonely. Hark! What was that? A chill passed over his body. The familiar, long-drawn howl broke the void, and it was close at hand. Then on his darkened eyes was projected the vision of the moose--the old bull moose--the torn flanks and bloody sides, the riddled mane, and the great branching horns, down low and tossing to the last. He saw the flashing forms of gray, the gleaming eyes, the lolling tongues, the slavered fangs. And he saw the inexorable circle close in till it became a dark point in the midst of the stamped snow.", "A cold muzzle thrust against his cheek, and at its touch his soul leaped back to the present. His hand shot into the fire and dragged out a burning faggot. Overcome for the nonce by his hereditary fear of man, the brute retreated, raising a prolonged call to his brothers; and greedily they answered, till a ring of crouching, jaw-slobbered gray was stretched round about. The old man listened to the drawing in of this circle. He waved his brand wildly, and sniffs turned to snarls; but the panting brutes refused to scatter. Now one wormed his chest forward, dragging his haunches after, now a second, now a third; but never a one drew back. Why should he cling to life? he asked, and dropped the blazing stick into the snow. It sizzled and went out. The circle grunted uneasily, but held its own. Again he saw the last stand of the old bull moose, and Koskoosh dropped his head wearily upon his knees. What did it matter after all? Was it not the law of life?", "\"Nam-Bok was ever clumsy at the paddle,\" she maundered reminiscently, shading the sun from her eyes and staring across the silver-spilled water. \"Nam-Bok was ever clumsy. I remember....\"", "But the women and children laughed loudly, and there was a gentle mockery in their laughter, and her voice dwindled till her lips moved without sound.", "Koogah lifted his grizzled head from his bone-carving and followed the path of her eyes. Except when wide yaws took it off its course, a bidarka was heading in for the beach. Its occupant was paddling with more strength than dexterity, and made his approach along the zigzag line of most resistance. Koogah's head dropped to his work again, and on the ivory tusk between his knees he scratched the dorsal fin of a fish the like of which never swam in the sea.", "\"It is doubtless the man from the next village,\" he said finally, \"come to consult with me about the marking of things on bone. And the man is a clumsy man. He will never know how.\"", "\"It is Nam-Bok,\" old Bask-Wah-Wan repeated. \"Should I not know my son?\" she demanded shrilly. \"I say, and I say again, it is Nam-Bok.\"", "\"And so thou hast said these many summers,\" one of the women chided softly. \"Ever when the ice passed out of the sea hast thou sat and watched through the long day, saying at each chance canoe, 'This is Nam-Bok.' Nam-Bok is dead, O Bask-Wah-Wan, and the dead do not come back. It cannot be that the dead come back.\"", "She struggled to her feet and tottered down the sand. She stumbled over a baby lying in the sun, and the mother hushed its crying and hurled harsh words after the old woman, who took no notice. The children ran down the beach in advance of her, and as the man in the bidarka drew closer, nearly capsizing with one of his ill-directed strokes, the women followed. Koogah dropped his walrus tusk and went also, leaning heavily upon his staff, and after him loitered the men in twos and threes.", "The bidarka turned broadside and the ripple of surf threatened to swamp it, only a naked boy ran into the water and pulled the bow high up on the sand. The man stood up and sent a questing glance along the line of villagers. A rainbow sweater, dirty and the worse for wear, clung loosely to his broad shoulders, and a red cotton handkerchief was knotted in sailor fashion about his throat. A fisherman's tam-o'-shanter on his close-clipped head, and dungaree trousers and heavy brogans, completed his outfit.", "But he was none the less a striking personage to these simple fisherfolk of the great Yukon Delta, who, all their lives, had stared out on Bering Sea and in that time seen but two white men,--the census enumerator and a lost Jesuit priest. They were a poor people, with neither gold in the ground nor valuable furs in hand, so the whites had passed them afar. Also, the Yukon, through the thousands of years, had shoaled that portion of the sea with the detritus of Alaska till vessels grounded out of sight of land. So the sodden coast, with its long inside reaches and huge mud-land archipelagoes, was avoided by the ships of men, and the fisherfolk knew not that such things were.", "Koogah, the Bone-Scratcher, retreated backward in sudden haste, tripping over his staff and falling to the ground. \"Nam-Bok!\" he cried, as he scrambled wildly for footing. \"Nam-Bok, who was blown off to sea, come back!\"", "The men and women shrank away, and the children scuttled off between their legs. Only Opee-Kwan was brave, as befitted the head man of the village. He strode forward and gazed long and earnestly at the new-comer.", "\"It _is_ Nam-Bok,\" he said at last, and at the conviction in his voice the women wailed apprehensively and drew farther away.", "\"La la, it is Nam-Bok,\" Bask-Wah-Wan croaked, peering up into his face. \"Ever did I say Nam-Bok would come back.\"", "\"Ay, it is Nam-Bok come back.\" This time it was Nam-Bok himself who spoke, putting a leg over the side of the bidarka and standing with one foot afloat and one ashore. Again his throat writhed and wrestled as he grappled after forgotten words. And when the words came forth they were strange of sound and a spluttering of the lips accompanied the gutturals. \"Greeting, O brothers,\" he said, \"brothers of old time before I went away with the off-shore wind.\"", "\"Dead men are not fat,\" Opee-Kwan confessed. \"Thou hast fared well, but it is strange. No man may mate with the off-shore wind and come back on the heels of the years.\"", "But Opee-Kwan doubted, and brushed his hand across his brow in sore puzzlement. Nam-Bok was likewise puzzled, and as he looked up and down the line found no welcome in the eyes of the fisherfolk. The men and women whispered together. The children stole timidly back among their elders, and bristling dogs fawned up to him and sniffed suspiciously.", "\"I bore thee, Nam-Bok, and I gave thee suck when thou wast little,\" Bask-Wah-Wan whimpered, drawing closer; \"and shadow though thou be, or no shadow, I will give thee to eat now.\"", "Nam-Bok made to come to her, but a growl of fear and menace warned him back. He said something in a strange tongue which sounded like \"Goddam,\" and added, \"No shadow am I, but a man.\"", "\"Who may know concerning the things of mystery?\" Opee-Kwan demanded, half of himself and half of his tribespeople. \"We are, and in a breath we are not. If the man may become shadow, may not the shadow become man? Nam-Bok was, but is not. This we know, but we do not know if this be Nam-Bok or the shadow of Nam-Bok.\"", "Nam-Bok cleared his throat and made answer. \"In the old time long ago, thy father's father, Opee-Kwan, went away and came back on the heels of the years. Nor was a place by the fire denied him. It is said ...\" He paused significantly, and they hung on his utterance. \"It is said,\" he repeated, driving his point home with deliberation, \"that Sipsip, his _klooch_, bore him two sons after he came back.\"", "\"But he had no doings with the off-shore wind,\" Opee-Kwan retorted. \"He went away into the heart of the land, and it is in the nature of things that a man may go on and on into the land.\"", "\"And likewise the sea. But that is neither here nor there. It is said ... that thy father's father told strange tales of the things he saw.\"", "He pulled from the bidarka a shawl, marvellous of texture and color, and flung it about his mother's shoulders. The women voiced a collective sigh of admiration, and old Bask-Wah-Wan ruffled the gay material and patted it and crooned in childish joy.", "And Opee-Kwan knew that his people were eager, and further, he was aware himself of an itching curiosity concerning those untold tales. \"The fishing has been good,\" he said judiciously, \"and we have oil in plenty. So come, Nam-Bok, let us feast.\"", "Two of the men hoisted the bidarka on their shoulders and carried it up to the fire. Nam-Bok walked by the side of Opee-Kwan, and the villagers followed after, save those of the women who lingered a moment to lay caressing fingers on the shawl.", "There was little talk while the feast went on, though many and curious were the glances stolen at the son of Bask-Wah-Wan. This embarrassed him--not because he was modest of spirit, however, but for the fact that the stench of the seal-oil had robbed him of his appetite, and that he keenly desired to conceal his feelings on the subject.", "\"Eat; thou art hungry,\" Opee-Kwan commanded, and Nam-Bok shut both his eyes and shoved his fist into the big pot of putrid fish.", "\"La la, be not ashamed. The seal were many this year, and strong men are ever hungry.\" And Bask-Wah-Wan sopped a particularly offensive chunk of salmon into the oil and passed it fondly and dripping to her son.", "In despair, when premonitory symptoms warned him that his stomach was not so strong as of old, he filled his pipe and struck up a smoke. The people fed on noisily and watched. Few of them could boast of intimate acquaintance with the precious weed, though now and again small quantities and abominable qualities were obtained in trade from the Eskimos to the northward. Koogah, sitting next to him, indicated that he was not averse to taking a draw, and between two mouthfuls, with the oil thick on his lips, sucked away at the amber stem. And thereupon Nam-Bok held his stomach with a shaky hand and declined the proffered return. Koogah could keep the pipe, he said, for he had intended so to honor him from the first. And the people licked their fingers and approved of his liberality.", "Opee-Kwan rose to his feet \"And now, O Nam-Bok, the feast is ended, and we would listen concerning the strange things you have seen.\"", "The fisherfolk applauded with their hands, and gathering about them their work, prepared to listen. The men were busy fashioning spears and carving on ivory, while the women scraped the fat from the hides of the hair seal and made them pliable or sewed muclucs with threads of sinew. Nam-Bok's eyes roved over the scene, but there was not the charm about it that his recollection had warranted him to expect. During the years of his wandering he had looked forward to just this scene, and now that it had come he was disappointed. It was a bare and meagre life, he deemed, and not to be compared to the one to which he had become used. Still, he would open their eyes a bit, and his own eyes sparkled at the thought.", "\"Brothers,\" he began, with the smug complacency of a man about to relate the big things he has done, \"it was late summer of many summers back, with much such weather as this promises to be, when I went away. You all remember the day, when the gulls flew low, and the wind blew strong from the land, and I could not hold my bidarka against it. I tied the covering of the bidarka about me so that no water could get in, and all of the night I fought with the storm. And in the morning there was no land,--only the sea,--and the off-shore wind held me close in its arms and bore me along. Three such nights whitened into dawn and showed me no land, and the off-shore wind would not let me go.", "\"And when the fourth day came, I was as a madman. I could not dip my paddle for want of food; and my head went round and round, what of the thirst that was upon me. But the sea was no longer angry, and the soft south wind was blowing, and as I looked about me I saw a sight that made me think I was indeed mad.\"", "Nam-Bok paused to pick away a sliver of salmon lodged between his teeth, and the men and women, with idle hands and heads craned forward, waited.", "\"It was a canoe, a big canoe. If all the canoes I have ever seen were made into one canoe, it would not be so large.\"", "\"If each bidarka were as a grain of sand,\" Nam-Bok defiantly continued, \"and if there were as many bidarkas as there be grains of sand in this beach, still would they not make so big a canoe as this I saw on the morning of the fourth day. It was a very big canoe, and it was called a _schooner_. I saw this thing of wonder, this great schooner, coming after me, and on it I saw men--\"", "\"The sides were tall, the men short.\" Opee-Kwan stated the premises with conviction. \"And did these men dip with long paddles?\"", "Mouths remained open, and a long silence dropped down. Opee-Kwan borrowed Koogah's pipe for a couple of contemplative sucks. One of the younger women giggled nervously and drew upon herself angry eyes.", "\"The schooner had wings--thus.\" He sketched a diagram of masts and sails in the sand, and the men crowded around and studied it. The wind was blowing briskly, and for more graphic elucidation he seized the corners of his mother's shawl and spread them out till it bellied like a sail. Bask-Wah-Wan scolded and struggled, but was blown down the beach for a score of feet and left breathless and stranded in a heap of driftwood. The men uttered sage grunts of comprehension, but Koogah suddenly tossed back his hoary head.", "\"Ho! Ho!\" he laughed. \"A foolish thing, this big canoe! A most foolish thing! The plaything of the wind! Wheresoever the wind goes, it goes too. No man who journeys therein may name the landing beach, for always he goes with the wind, and the wind goes everywhere, but no man knows where.\"", "\"It is so,\" Opee-Kwan supplemented gravely. \"With the wind the going is easy, but against the wind a man striveth hard; and for that they had no paddles these men on the big canoe did not strive at all.\"", "\"Then the wind made the sch--sch--schooner go against the wind.\" Old Koogah dropped an open leer to Opee-Kwan, and, the laughter growing around him, continued: \"The wind blows from the south and blows the schooner south. The wind blows against the wind. The wind blows one way and the other at the same time. It is very simple. We understand, Nam-Bok. We clearly understand.\"", "But Nam-Bok's face was dark, and he said rapid words which they had never heard before. Bone-scratching and skin-scraping were resumed, but he shut his lips tightly on the tongue that could not be believed.", "He lapsed into sullen silence again, and Opee-Kwan nudged Koogah, who shook his head with slow amazement and murmured, \"It is very strange.\"", "Nam-bok took the bait. \"That is nothing,\" he said airily; \"you should see the _steamer_. As the grain of sand is to the bidarka, as the bidarka is to the schooner, so the schooner is to the steamer. Further, the steamer is made of iron. It is all iron.\"", "\"Nay, nay, Nam-Bok,\" cried the head man; \"how can that be? Always iron goes to the bottom. For behold, I received an iron knife in trade from the head man of the next village, and yesterday the iron knife slipped from my fingers and went down, down, into the sea. To all things there be law. Never was there one thing outside the law. This we know. And, moreover, we know that things of a kind have the one law, and that all iron has the one law. So unsay thy words, Nam-Bok, that we may yet honor thee.\"", "\"But tell me, Nam-Bok,\" Koogah interrupted, for fear the tale would go no farther, \"tell me the manner of these men in finding their way across the sea when there is no land by which to steer.\"", "\"At midday the head man of the schooner takes a thing through which his eye looks at the sun, and then he makes the sun climb down out of the sky to the edge of the earth.\"", "\"Now this be evil medicine!\" cried Opee-Kwan, aghast at the sacrilege. The men held up their hands in horror, and the women moaned. \"This be evil medicine. It is not good to misdirect the great sun which drives away the night and gives us the seal, the salmon, and warm weather.\"", "\"What if it be evil medicine?\" Nam-Bok demanded truculently. \"I, too, have looked through the thing at the sun and made the sun climb down out of the sky.\"", "Those who were nearest drew away from him hurriedly, and a woman covered the face of a child at her breast so that his eye might not fall upon it.", "\"But on the morning of the fourth day, O Nam-Bok,\" Koogah suggested; \"on the morning of the fourth day when the sch--sch--schooner came after thee?\"", "\"I had little strength left in me and could not run away. So I was taken on board and water was poured down my throat and good food given me. Twice, my brothers, you have seen a white man. These men were all white and as many as have I fingers and toes. And when I saw they were full of kindness, I took heart, and I resolved to bring away with me report of all that I saw. And they taught me the work they did, and gave me good food and a place to sleep.", "\"And day after day we went over the sea, and each day the head man drew the sun down out of the sky and made it tell where we were. And when the waves were kind, we hunted the fur seal and I marvelled much, for always did they fling the meat and the fat away and save only the skin.\"", "Opee-Kwan's mouth was twitching violently, and he was about to make denunciation of such waste when Koogah kicked him to be still.", "\"After a weary time, when the sun was gone and the bite of the frost come into the air, the head man pointed the nose of the schooner south. South and east we travelled for days upon days, with never the land in sight, and we were near to the village from which hailed the men--\"", "\"How did they know they were near?\" Opee-Kwan, unable to contain himself longer, demanded. \"There was no land to see.\"", "Nam-Bok glowered on him wrathfully. \"Did I not say the head man brought the sun down out of the sky?\"", "\"As I say, when we were near to that village a great storm blew up, and in the night we were helpless and knew not where we were--\"", "\"Oh, peace, Opee-Kwan! Thou art a fool and cannot understand. As I say, we were helpless in the night, when I heard, above the roar of the storm, the sound of the sea on the beach. And next we struck with a mighty crash and I was in the water, swimming. It was a rock-bound coast, with one patch of beach in many miles, and the law was that I should dig my hands into the sand and draw myself clear of the surf. The other men must have pounded against the rocks, for none of them came ashore but the head man, and him I knew only by the ring on his finger.", "\"When day came, there being nothing of the schooner, I turned my face to the land and journeyed into it that I might get food and look upon the faces of the people. And when I came to a house I was taken in and given to eat, for I had learned their speech, and the white men are ever kindly. And it was a house bigger than all the houses built by us and our fathers before us.\"", "\"That is nothing.\" Nam-Bok shrugged his shoulders in belittling fashion. \"As our houses are to that house, so that house was to the houses I was yet to see.\"", "\"Nay; mere men like you and me,\" Nam-Bok answered. \"I had cut a stick that I might walk in comfort, and remembering that I was to bring report to you, my brothers, I cut a notch in the stick for each person who lived in that house. And I stayed there many days, and worked, for which they gave me _money_--a thing of which you know nothing, but which is very good.", "\"And one day I departed from that place to go farther into the land. And as I walked I met many people, and I cut smaller notches in the stick, that there might be room for all. Then I came upon a strange thing. On the ground before me was a bar of iron, as big in thickness as my arm, and a long step away was another bar of iron--\"", "\"Then wert thou a rich man,\" Opee-Kwan asserted; \"for iron be worth more than anything else in the world. It would have made many knives.\"", "\"Not so; the white men had placed it there And further, these bars were so long that no man could carry them away--so long that as far as I could see there was no end to them.\"", "\"Ay, it was hard to believe with my own eyes upon it; but I could not gainsay my eyes. And as I looked I heard....\" He turned abruptly upon the head man. \"Opee-Kwan, thou hast heard the sea-lion bellow in his anger. Make it plain in thy mind of as many sea-lions as there be waves to the sea, and make it plain that all these sea-lions be made into one sea-lion, and as that one sea-lion would bellow so bellowed the thing I heard.\"", "\"And in the distance I saw a monster like unto a thousand whales. It was one-eyed, and vomited smoke, and it snorted with exceeding loudness. I was afraid and ran with shaking legs along the path between the bars. But it came with the speed of the wind, this monster, and I leaped the iron bars with its breath hot on my face....\"", "\"Then it came by on the bars, and harmed me not; and when my legs could hold me up again it was gone from sight. And it is a very common thing in that country. Even the women and children are not afraid. Men make them to do work, these monsters.\"", "\"They breed not at all. Men fashion them cunningly of iron, and feed them with stone, and give them water to drink. The stone becomes fire, and the water becomes steam, and the steam of the water is the breath of their nostrils, and--\"", "\"There, there, O Nam-Bok,\" Opee-Kwan interrupted. \"Tell us of other wonders. We grow tired of this which we may not understand.\"", "Nam-Bok thought of a combined harvester, and of the machines wherein visions of living men were to be seen, and of the machines from which came the voices of men, and he knew his people could never understand.", "\"And likewise, thou fool, I said money was a thing of which you know nothing. As I say, I rode the monster through the land, and through many villages, until I came to a big village on a salt arm of the sea. And the houses shoved their roofs among the stars in the sky, and the clouds drifted by them, and everywhere was much smoke. And the roar of that village was like the roar of the sea in storm, and the people were so many that I flung away my stick and no longer remembered the notches upon it.\"", "Nam-Bok whirled upon him in anger. \"Had I made small notches! Listen, Koogah, thou scratcher of bone! If I had made small notches, neither the stick, nor twenty sticks, could have borne them--nay, not all the driftwood of all the beaches between this village and the next. And if all of you, the women and children as well, were twenty times as many, and if you had twenty hands each, and in each hand a stick and a knife, still the notches could not be cut for the people I saw, so many were they and so fast did they come and go.\"", "\"There cannot be so many people in all the world,\" Opee-Kwan objected, for he was stunned and his mind could not grasp such magnitude of numbers.", "\"It stands to reason there cannot be so many people in one place. Their canoes would clutter the sea till there was no room. And they could empty the sea each day of its fish, and they would not all be fed.\"", "\"So it would seem,\" Nam-Bok made final answer; \"yet it was so. With my own eyes I saw, and flung my stick away.\" He yawned heavily and rose to his feet. \"I have paddled far. The day has been long, and I am tired. Now I will sleep, and to-morrow we will have further talk upon the things I have seen.\"", "Bask-Wah-Wan, hobbling fearfully in advance, proud indeed, yet awed by her wonderful son, led him to her igloo and stowed him away among the greasy, ill-smelling furs. But the men lingered by the fire, and a council was held wherein was there much whispering and low-voiced discussion.", "An hour passed, and a second, and Nam-Bok slept, and the talk went on. The evening sun dipped toward the northwest, and at eleven at night was nearly due north. Then it was that the head man and the bone-scratcher separated themselves from the council and aroused Nam-Bok. He blinked up into their faces and turned on his side to sleep again. Opee-Kwan gripped him by the arm and kindly but firmly shook his senses back into him.", "But Opee-Kwan spoke more softly. \"Thou wast bidarka-mate with me when we were boys,\" he said. \"Together we first chased the seal and drew the salmon from the traps. And thou didst drag me back to life, Nam-Bok, when the sea closed over me and I was sucked down to the black rocks. Together we hungered and bore the chill of the frost, and together we crawled beneath the one fur and lay close to each other. And because of these things, and the kindness in which I stood to thee, it grieves me sore that thou shouldst return such a remarkable liar. We cannot understand, and our heads be dizzy with the things thou hast spoken. It is not good, and there has been much talk in the council. Wherefore we send thee away, that our heads may remain clear and strong and be not troubled by the unaccountable things.\"", "\"These things thou speakest of be shadows,\" Koogah took up the strain. \"From the shadow-world thou hast brought them, and to the shadow-world thou must return them. Thy bidarka be ready, and the tribespeople wait. They may not sleep until thou art gone.\"", "\"If thou art Nam-Bok,\" Opee-Kwan was saying, \"thou art a fearful and most wonderful liar; if thou art the shadow of Nam-Bok, then thou speakest of shadows, concerning which it is not good that living men have knowledge. This great village thou hast spoken of we deem the village of shadows. Therein flutter the souls of the dead; for the dead be many and the living few. The dead do not come back. Never have the dead come back--save thou with thy wonder-tales. It is not meet that the dead come back, and should we permit it, great trouble may be our portion.\"", "Nam-Bok knew his people well and was aware that the voice of the council was supreme. So he allowed himself to be led down to the water's edge, where he was put aboard his bidarka and a paddle thrust into his hand. A stray wild-fowl honked somewhere to seaward, and the surf broke limply and hollowly on the sand. A dim twilight brooded over land and water, and in the north the sun smouldered, vague and troubled, and draped about with blood-red mists. The gulls were flying low. The off-shore wind blew keen and chill, and the black-massed clouds behind it gave promise of bitter weather.", "\"Out of the sea thou earnest,\" Opee-Kwan chanted oracularly, \"and back into the sea thou goest. Thus is balance achieved and all things brought to law.\"", "But Koogah, shoving Nam-Bok clear of the beach, tore the shawl from her shoulders and flung it into the bidarka.", "Nam-Bok stood up that his voice might carry. \"O Bask-Wah-Wan, mother that bore me!\" he called. \"Listen to the words of Nam-Bok, thy son. There be room in his bidarka for two, and he would that thou camest with him. For his journey is to where there are fish and oil in plenty. There the frost comes not, and life is easy, and the things of iron do the work of men. Wilt thou come, O Bask-Wah-Wan?\"", "She debated a moment, while the bidarka drifted swiftly from her, then raised her voice to a quavering treble. \"I am old, Nam-Bok, and soon I shall pass down among the shadows. But I have no wish to go before my time. I am old, Nam-Bok, and I am afraid.\"", "A shaft of light shot across the dim-lit sea and wrapped boat and man in a splendor of red and gold. Then a hush fell upon the fisherfolk, and only was heard the moan of the off-shore wind and the cries of the gulls flying low in the air.", "There was complaint in the village. The women chattered together with shrill, high-pitched voices. The men were glum and doubtful of aspect, and the very dogs wandered dubiously about, alarmed in vague ways by the unrest of the camp, and ready to take to the woods on the first outbreak of trouble. The air was filled with suspicion. No man was sure of his neighbor, and each was conscious that he stood in like unsureness with his fellows. Even the children were oppressed and solemn, and little Di Ya, the cause of it all, had been soundly thrashed, first by Hooniah, his mother, and then by his father, Bawn, and was now whimpering and looking pessimistically out upon the world from the shelter of the big overturned canoe on the beach.", "And to make the matter worse, Scundoo, the shaman, was in disgrace, and his known magic could not be called upon to seek out the evil-doer. Forsooth, a month gone, he had promised a fair south wind so that the tribe might journey to the _potlatch_ at Tonkin, where Taku Jim was giving away the savings of twenty years; and when the day came, lo, a grievous north wind blew, and of the first three canoes to venture forth, one was swamped in the big seas, and two were pounded to pieces on the rocks, and a child was drowned. He had pulled the string of the wrong bag, he explained,--a mistake. But the people refused to listen; the offerings of meat and fish and fur ceased to come to his door; and he sulked within--so they thought, fasting in bitter penance; in reality, eating generously from his well-stored cache and meditating upon the fickleness of the mob.", "The blankets of Hooniah were missing. They were good blankets, of most marvellous thickness and warmth, and her pride in them was greatened in that they had been come by so cheaply. Ty-Kwan, of the next village but one, was a fool to have so easily parted with them. But then, she did not know they were the blankets of the murdered Englishman, because of whose take-off the United States cutter nosed along the coast for a time, while its launches puffed and snorted among the secret inlets. And not knowing that Ty-Kwan had disposed of them in haste so that his own people might not have to render account to the Government, Hooniah's pride was unshaken. And because the women envied her, her pride was without end and boundless, till it filled the village and spilled over along the Alaskan shore from Dutch Harbor to St. Mary's. Her totem had become justly celebrated, and her name known on the lips of men wherever men fished and feasted, what of the blankets and their marvellous thickness and warmth. It was a most mysterious happening, the manner of their going.", "\"I but stretched them up in the sun by the side-wall of the house,\" Hooniah disclaimed for the thousandth time to her Thlinget sisters. \"I but stretched them up and turned my back; for Di Ya, dough-thief and eater of raw flour that he is, with head into the big iron pot, overturned and stuck there, his legs waving like the branches of a forest tree in the wind. And I did but drag him out and twice knock his head against the door for riper understanding, and behold, the blankets were not!\"", "\"A great loss,\" one added. A second, \"Never were there such blankets.\" And a third, \"We be sorry, Hooniah, for thy loss.\" Yet each woman of them was glad in her heart that the odious, dissension-breeding blankets were gone. \"I but stretched them up in the sun,\" Hooniah began for the thousand and first time.", "\"Yea, yea,\" Bawn spoke up, wearied. \"But there were no gossips in the village from other places. Wherefore it be plain that some of our own tribespeople have laid unlawful hand upon the blankets.\"", "\"Ay,\" Hooniah affirmed, the latent malignancy of her nature flashing into a moment's exultation. \"And word has been sent to Klok-No-Ton, and strong paddles. Truly shall he be here with the afternoon tide.\"", "The little groups broke up, and fear descended upon the village. Of all misfortune, witchcraft was the most appalling. With the intangible and unseen things only the shamans could cope, and neither man, woman, nor child could know, until the moment of ordeal, whether devils possessed their souls or not. And of all shamans, Klok-No-Ton, who dwelt in the next village, was the most terrible. None found more evil spirits than he, none visited his victims with more frightful tortures. Even had he found, once, a devil residing within the body of a three-months babe--a most obstinate devil which could only be driven out when the babe had lain for a week on thorns and briers. The body was thrown into the sea after that, but the waves tossed it back again and again as a curse upon the village, nor did it finally go away till two strong men were staked out at low tide and drowned.", "And Hooniah had sent for this Klok-No-Ton. Better had it been if Scundoo, their own shaman, were undisgraced. For he had ever a gentler way, and he had been known to drive forth two devils from a man who afterward begat seven healthy children. But Klok-No-Ton! They shuddered with dire foreboding at thought of him, and each one felt himself the centre of accusing eyes, and looked accusingly upon his fellows--each one and all, save Sime, and Sime was a scoffer whose evil end was destined with a certitude his successes could not shake.", "\"Thou fool! Even now he cometh with witcheries and sorceries; so beware thy tongue, lest evil befall thee and thy days be short in the land!\"", "\"I am Sime, unused to fear, unafraid of the dark. I am a strong man, as my father before me, and my head is clear. Nor you nor I have seen with our eyes the unseen evil things--\"", "Sime snorted. \"A shaman is only a man. May not his words be crooked, even as thine and mine? Bah! Bah! And once more, bah! And this for thy shamans and thy shamans' devils! and this! and this!\"", "And snapping his fingers to right and left, Sime strode through the on-lookers, who made over-zealous and fearsome way for him.", "\"Wherefore be thou evil and flourish,\" Sime retorted over his shoulder. \"And were all evil, there would be no need for shamans. Bah! You children-afraid-of-the-dark!\"", "And when Klok-No-Ton arrived on the afternoon tide, Sime's defiant laugh was unabated; nor did he forbear to make a joke when the shaman tripped on the sand in the landing. Klok-No-Ton looked at him sourly, and without greeting stalked straight through their midst to the house of Scundoo.", "Of the meeting with Scundoo none of the tribespeople might know, for they clustered reverently in the distance and spoke in whispers while the masters of mystery were together.", "He was a giant in stature, and towered massively above little Scundoo, whose thin voice floated upward like the faint far rasping of a cricket.", "\"Yea, yea,\" the little shaman put in impatiently, \"that I have fallen on ill days, else would I not stand in gratitude to you in that you do my work.\"", "\"Not so, good Klok-No-Ton,\" murmured Scundoo, with a deprecatory wave of the hand. \"It is I who am thy slave, and my days shall be filled with desire to befriend thee.\"", "The big shaman blundered tentatively in his quest, and Scundoo smiled a wan, gray smile, for he was used to reading men, and all men seemed very small to him.", "\"Ay, briefly known when I set eyes upon him.\" Again Klok-No-Ton hesitated. \"Have there been gossips from other places?\" he asked.", "\"Often have I thought,\" Scundoo concluded, his voice falling as he came to a full pause. \"It is a fair day, and thy medicine be strong, Klok-No-Ton.\"", "Klok-No-Ton's face brightened. \"Thou art a great man, Scundoo, a shaman of shamans. I go now. I shall remember thee always. And the man La-lah, as you say, is a remarkable man.\"", "Scundoo smiled yet more wan and gray, closed the door on the heels of his departing visitor, and barred and double-barred it.", "Sime was mending his canoe when Klok-No-Ton came down the beach, and he broke off from his work only long enough to ostentatiously load his rifle and place it near him.", "The shaman noted the action and called out: \"Let all the people come together on this spot! It is the word of Klok-No-Ton, devil-seeker and driver of devils!\"", "He had been minded to assemble them at Hooniah's house, but it was necessary that all should be present, and he was doubtful of Sime's obedience and did not wish trouble. Sime was a good man to let alone, his judgment ran, and withal, a bad one for the health of any shaman.", "\"Let the woman Hooniah be brought,\" Klok-No-Ton commanded, glaring ferociously about the circle and sending chills up and down the spines of those he looked upon.", "\"Him have I beaten sore, and he shall yet be beaten, for that he brought trouble upon us who be poor people.\"", "\"The blankets!\" Klok-No-Ton bellowed hoarsely, foreseeing her desire to lower the price to be paid. \"The blankets, woman! Thy wealth is known.\"", "He stiffened suddenly, with a hideous distortion of the face, and Hooniah shrank back. But so swiftly did he spring forward, with in-turned eyeballs and loosened jaw, that she stumbled and fell down grovelling at his feet. He waved his arms about, wildly flagellating the air, his body writhing and twisting in torment. An epilepsy seemed to come upon him. A white froth flecked his lips, and his body was convulsed with shiverings and tremblings.", "The women broke into a wailing chant, swaying backward and forward in abandonment, while one by one the men succumbed to the excitement till only Sime remained. He, perched upon his canoe, looked on in mockery; yet the ancestors whose seed he bore pressed heavily upon him, and he swore his strongest oaths that his courage might be cheered. Klok-No-Ton was horrible to behold. He had cast off his blanket and torn his clothes from him, so that he was quite naked, save for a girdle of eagle-claws about his thighs. Shrieking and yelling, his long black hair flying like a blot of night, he leaped frantically about the circle. A certain rude rhythm characterized his frenzy, and when all were under its sway, swinging their bodies in accord with his and venting their cries in unison, he sat bolt upright, with arm outstretched and long, talon-like finger extended. A low moaning, as of the dead, greeted this, and the people cowered with shaking knees as the dread finger passed them slowly by. For death went with it, and life remained with those who watched it go; and being rejected, they watched with eager intentness.", "Finally, with a tremendous cry, the fateful finger rested upon La-lah. He shook like an aspen, seeing himself already dead, his household goods divided, and his widow married to his brother. He strove to speak, to deny, but his tongue clove to his mouth and his throat was sanded with an intolerable thirst. Klok-No-Ton seemed to half swoon away, now that his work was done; but he waited, with closed eyes, listening for the great blood-cry to go up--the great blood-cry, familiar to his ear from a thousand conjurations, when the tribespeople flung themselves like wolves upon the trembling victim. But only was there silence, then a low tittering, from nowhere in particular, which spread and spread until a vast laughter welled up to the sky.", "\"It be known to all,\" La-lah stuttered. \"For eight weary months have I been gone afar with the Siwash sealers, and but this day am I come back to find the blankets of Hooniah gone ere I came!\"", "\"And thou shalt be paid nothing for thy medicine which is of no avail,\" announced Hooniah, on her feet once more and smarting from a sense of ridiculousness.", "But Klok-No-Ton saw only the face of Scundoo and its wan, gray smile, heard only the faint far cricket's rasping. \"I got it from the man La-lah, and often have I thought,\" and, \"It is a fair day and thy medicine be strong.\"", "He brushed by Hooniah, and the circle instinctively gave way for him to pass. Sime flung a jeer from the top of the canoe, the women snickered in his face, cries of derision rose in his wake, but he took no notice, pressing onward to the house of Scundoo. He hammered on the door, beat it with his fists, and howled vile imprecations. Yet there was no response, save that in the lulls Scundoo's voice rose eerily in incantation. Klok-No-Ton raged about like a madman, but when he attempted to break in the door with a huge stone, murmurs arose from the men and women. And he, Klok-No-Ton, knew that he stood shorn of his strength and authority before an alien people. He saw a man stoop for a stone, and a second, and a bodily fear ran through him.", "Klok-No-Ton turned on his heel and went down among them to the beach, a bitter rage at his heart, and in his head a just apprehension for his defenceless back. But no stones were cast. The children swarmed mockingly about his feet, and the air was wild with laughter and derision, but that was all. Yet he did not breathe freely until the canoe was well out upon the water, when he rose up and laid a futile curse upon the village and its people, not forgetting to particularly specify Scundoo who had made a mock of him.", "Ashore there was a clamor for Scundoo, and the whole population crowded his door, entreating and imploring in confused babel till he came forth and raised his hand.", "\"In that ye are my children I pardon freely,\" he said. \"But never again. For the last time thy foolishness goes unpunished. That which ye wish shall be granted, and it be already known to me. This night, when the moon has gone behind the world to look upon the mighty dead, let all the people gather in the blackness before the house of Hooniah. Then shall the evil-doer stand forth and take his merited reward. I have spoken.\"", "\"Children of foolishness, these Thlinket people!\" Sime smote his thigh a resounding blow. \"It passeth understanding that grown women and strong men should get down in the dirt to dream-things and wonder tales.\"", "\"I am a travelled man,\" La-lah answered. \"I have journeyed on the deep seas and seen signs and wonders, and I know that these things be so. I am La-lah--\"", "When the last silver moonlight had vanished beyond the world, Scundoo came among the people huddled about the house of Hooniah. He walked with a quick, alert step, and those who saw him in the light of Hooniah's slush-lamp noticed that he came empty-handed, without rattles, masks, or shaman's paraphernalia, save for a great sleepy raven carried under one arm.", "\"Then let all listen, for my words be few. With me have I brought Jelchs, the Raven, diviner of mystery and seer of things. Him, in his blackness, shall I place under the big black pot of Hooniah, in the blackest corner of her house. The slush-lamp shall cease to burn, and all remain in outer darkness. It is very simple. One by one shall ye go into the house, lay hand upon the pot for the space of one long intake of the breath, and withdraw again. Doubtless Jelchs will make outcry when the hand of the evil-doer is nigh him. Or who knows but otherwise he may manifest his wisdom. Are ye ready?\"", "Thereat La-lah was first chosen, and he passed in at once. Every ear strained, and through the silence they could hear his footsteps creaking across the rickety floor. But that was all. Jelchs made no outcry, gave no sign. Bawn was next chosen, for it well might be that a man should steal his own blankets with intent to cast shame upon his neighbors. Hooniah followed, and other women and children, but without result.", "Sime chuckled. \"I laugh at it all, for it is a great foolishness. Yet will I go in, not in belief in wonders, but in token that I am unafraid.\"", "\"I doubt not,\" the scoffer answered airily. \"Few men of us die in our beds, what of the shamans and the deep sea.\"", "When half the villagers had safely undergone the ordeal, the excitement, because of its repression, was painfully intense. When two-thirds had gone through, a young woman, close on her first child-bed, broke down and in nervous shrieks and laughter gave form to her terror.", "Finally the turn came for the last of all to go in, and nothing had happened. And Di Ya was the last of all. It must surely be he. Hooniah let out a lament to the stars, while the rest drew back from the luckless lad. He was half-dead from fright, and his legs gave under him so that he staggered on the threshold and nearly fell. Scundoo shoved him inside and closed the door. A long time went by, during which could be heard only the boy's weeping. Then, very slowly, came the creak of his steps to the far corner, a pause, and the creaking of his return. The door opened and he came forth. Nothing had happened, and he was the last.", "Sime threw his chest out arrogantly and strutted up to the little shaman. \"Hoh! Hoh! As I said, nothing has come of it!\"", "\"So it would seem, so it would seem,\" Scundoo answered meekly. \"And it would seem strange to those unskilled in the affairs of mystery.\"", "\"Mayhap even as I.\" Scundoo spoke quite softly, his eyelids drooping, slowly drooping, down, down, till his eyes were all but hidden. \"So I am minded of another test. Let every man, woman, and child, now and at once, hold their hands well up above their heads!\"", "So unexpected was the order, and so imperatively was it given, that it was obeyed without question. Every hand was in the air.", "But a noise of laughter, which was more of wrath, drowned his voice. All eyes had come to rest upon Sime. Every hand but his was black with soot, and his was guiltless of the smirch of Hooniah's pot.", "A second stone gashed his brow, a third whistled past his head, the great blood-cry went up, and everywhere were people groping on the ground for missiles. He staggered and half sank down.", "\"In the large skin-bale in my house, the one slung by the ridge-pole,\" came the answer. \"But it was a joke, I say, only--\"", "Scundoo nodded his head, and the air went thick with flying stones. Sime's wife was crying silently, her head upon her knees; but his little boy, with shrieks and laughter, was flinging stones with the rest.", "\"Nay, it was never my way, good Hooniah,\" Scundoo made answer, reaching for the blankets. \"In token that I am not hard, these only shall I take.\"", "Mandell is an obscure village on the rim of the polar sea. It is not large, and the people are peaceable, more peaceable even than those of the adjacent tribes. There are few men in Mandell, and many women; wherefore a wholesome and necessary polygamy is in practice; the women bear children with ardor, and the birth of a man-child is hailed with acclamation. Then there is Aab-Waak, whose head rests always on one shoulder, as though at some time the neck had become very tired and refused forevermore its wonted duty.", "The cause of all these things,--the peaceableness, and the polygamy, and the tired neck of Aab-Waak,--goes back among the years to the time when the schooner _Search_ dropped anchor in Mandell Bay, and when Tyee, chief man of the tribe, conceived a scheme of sudden wealth. To this day the story of things that happened is remembered and spoken of with bated breath by the people of Mandell, who are cousins to the Hungry Folk who live in the west. Children draw closer when the tale is told, and marvel sagely to themselves at the madness of those who might have been their forebears had they not provoked the Sunlanders and come to bitter ends.", "It began to happen when six men came ashore from the _Search_, with heavy outfits, as though they had come to stay, and quartered themselves in Neegah's igloo. Not but that they paid well in flour and sugar for the lodging, but Neegah was aggrieved because Mesahchie, his daughter, elected to cast her fortunes and seek food and blanket with Bill-Man, who was leader of the party of white men.", "\"She is worth a price,\" Neegah complained to the gathering by the council-fire, when the six white men were asleep. \"She is worth a price, for we have more men than women, and the men be bidding high. The hunter Ounenk offered me a kayak, new-made, and a gun which he got in trade from the Hungry Folk. This was I offered, and behold, now she is gone and I have nothing!\"", "\"I, too, did bid for Mesahchie,\" grumbled a voice, in tones not altogether joyless, and Peelo shoved his broad-cheeked, jovial face for a moment into the light.", "\"Thou, too,\" Neegah affirmed. \"And there were others. Why is there such a restlessness upon the Sunlanders?\" he demanded petulantly. \"Why do they not stay at home? The Snow People do not wander to the lands of the Sunlanders.\"", "\"Better were it to ask why they come,\" cried a voice from the darkness, and Aab-Waak pushed his way to the front.", "\"Men do not dig in the ground for nothing,\" he began. \"And I have it in mind of the Whale People, who are likewise Sunlanders, and who lost their ship in the ice. You all remember the Whale People, who came to us in their broken boats, and who went away into the south with dogs and sleds when the frost arrived and snow covered the land. And you remember, while they waited for the frost, that one man of them dug in the ground, and then two men and three, and then all men of them, with great excitement and much disturbance. What they dug out of the ground we do not know, for they drove us away so we could not see. But afterward, when they were gone, we looked and found nothing. Yet there be much ground and they did not dig it all.\"", "\"Wherefore I have it in mind,\" he concluded, \"that one Sunlander tells another, and that these Sunlanders have been so told and are come to dig in the ground.\"", "\"But how can it be that Bill-Man speaks our tongue?\" demanded a little weazened old hunter,--\"Bill-Man, upon whom never before our eyes have rested?\"", "\"Bill-Man has been other times in the Snow Lands,\" Aab-Waak answered, \"else would he not speak the speech of the Bear People, which is like the speech of the Hungry Folk, which is very like the speech of the Mandells. For there have been many Sunlanders among the Bear People, few among the Hungry Folk, and none at all among the Mandells, save the Whale People and those who sleep now in the igloo of Neegah.\"", "\"They have great wealth,\" Ounenk added. \"Yesterday I was to their ship, and beheld most cunning tools of iron, and knives, and guns, and flour, and sugar, and strange foods without end.\"", "\"It is so, brothers!\" Tyee stood up and exulted inwardly at the respect and silence his people accorded him. \"They be very rich, these Sunlanders. Also, they be fools. For behold! They come among us boldly, blindly, and without thought for all of their great wealth. Even now they snore, and we are many and unafraid.\"", "But Tyee scowled upon him. \"Nay, it would not seem so. They live to the south, under the path of the sun, and are soft as their dogs are soft. You remember the dog of the Whale People? Our dogs ate him the second day, for he was soft and could not fight. The sun is warm and life easy in the Sun Lands, and the men are as women, and the women as children.\"", "\"It is said they are good to their women, who do little work,\" tittered Likeeta, a broad-hipped, healthy young woman, daughter to Tyee himself.", "\"Thou wouldst follow the feet of Mesahchie, eh?\" he cried angrily. Then he turned swiftly to the tribesmen. \"Look you, brothers, this is the way of the Sunlanders! They have eyes for our women, and take them one by one. As Mesahchie has gone, cheating Neegah of her price, so will Likeeta go, so will they all go, and we be cheated. I have talked with a hunter from the Bear People, and I know. There be Hungry Folk among us; let them speak if my words be true.\"", "The six hunters of the Hungry Folk attested the truth and fell each to telling his neighbor of the Sunlanders and their ways. There were mutterings from the younger men, who had wives to seek, and from the older men, who had daughters to fetch prices, and a low hum of rage rose higher and clearer.", "\"They are very rich, and have cunning tools of iron, and knives, and guns without end,\" Tyee suggested craftily, his dream of sudden wealth beginning to take shape.", "\"Peace! O brothers!\" Tyee swept the assembly with his hands. \"Let the women and children go to their igloos. This is the talk of men; let it be for the ears of men.\"", "\"There be guns in plenty for all,\" he said when the women had unwillingly withdrawn. \"I doubt not there will be two guns for each man, without thought of the flour and sugar and other things. And it is easy. The six Sunlanders in Neegah's igloo will we kill to-night while they sleep. To-morrow will we go in peace to the ship to trade, and there, when the time favors, kill all their brothers. And to-morrow night there shall be feasting and merriment and division of wealth. And the least man shall possess more than did ever the greatest before. Is it wise, that which I have spoken, brothers?\"", "A low growl of approval answered him, and preparation for the attack was begun. The six Hungry Folk, as became members of a wealthier tribe, were armed with rifles and plenteously supplied with ammunition. But it was only here and there that a Mandell possessed a gun, many of which were broken, and there was a general slackness of powder and shells. This poverty of war weapons, however, was relieved by myriads of bone-headed arrows and casting-spears for work at a distance, and for close quarters steel knives of Russian and Yankee make.", "\"Let there be no noise,\" Tyee finally instructed; \"but be there many on every side of the igloo, and close, so that the Sunlanders may not break through. Then do you, Neegah, with six of the young men behind, crawl in to where they sleep. Take no guns, which be prone to go off at unexpected times, but put the strength of your arms into the knives.\"", "Flat upon the ground, the small army concentred on the igloo, and behind, deliciously expectant, crouched many women and children, come out to witness the murder. The brief August night was passing, and in the gray of dawn could be dimly discerned the creeping forms of Neegah and the young men. Without pause, on hands and knees, they entered the long passageway and disappeared. Tyee rose up and rubbed his hands. All was going well. Head after head in the big circle lifted and waited. Each man pictured the scene according to his nature--the sleeping men, the plunge of the knives, and the sudden death in the dark.", "A loud hail, in the voice of a Sunlander, rent the silence, and a shot rang out. Then an uproar broke loose inside the igloo. Without premeditation, the circle swept forward into the passageway. On the inside, half a dozen repeating rifles began to chatter, and the Mandells, jammed in the confined space, were powerless. Those at the front strove madly to retreat from the fire-spitting guns in their very faces, and those in the rear pressed as madly forward to the attack. The bullets from the big 45:90's drove through half a dozen men at a shot, and the passageway, gorged with surging, helpless men, became a shambles. The rifles, pumped without aim into the mass, withered it away like a machine gun, and against that steady stream of death no man could advance.", "\"Never was there the like!\" panted one of the Hungry Folk. \"I did but look in, and the dead were piled like seals on the ice after a killing!\"", "\"O ye fools!\" Tyee chided. \"Ye sons of fools! It was not planned, this thing ye have done. To Neegah and the six young men only was it given to go inside. My cunning is superior to the cunning of the Sunlanders, but ye take away its edge, and rob me of its strength, and make it worse than no cunning at all!\"", "No one made reply, and all eyes centred on the igloo, which loomed vague and monstrous against the clear northeast sky. Through a hole in the roof the smoke from the rifles curled slowly upward in the pulseless air, and now and again a wounded man crawled painfully through the gray.", "\"The more wealth for those who are left,\" Tyee grimly consoled. Then, turning to Aab-Waak, he said: \"Go thou, and gather together many sealskins filled with oil. Let the hunters empty them on the outside wood of the igloo and of the passage. And let them put fire to it ere the Sunlanders make holes in the igloo for their guns.\"", "Even as he spoke a hole appeared in the dirt plastered between the logs, a rifle muzzle protruded, and one of the Hungry Folk clapped hand to his side and leaped in the air. A second shot, through the lungs, brought him to the ground. Tyee and the rest scattered to either side, out of direct range, and Aab-Waak hastened the men forward with the skins of oil. Avoiding the loopholes, which were making on every side of the igloo, they emptied the skins on the dry drift-logs brought down by the Mandell River from the tree-lands to the south. Ounenk ran forward with a blazing brand, and the flames leaped upward. Many minutes passed, without sign, and they held their weapons ready as the fire gained headway.", "Tyee rubbed his hands gleefully as the dry structure burned and crackled. \"Now we have them, brothers! In the trap!\"", "Covered with a singed and blackened blanket, the big white man leaped out of the blazing entrance, and on his heels, likewise shielded, came Mesahchie, and the five other Sunlanders. The Hungry Folk tried to check the rush with an ill-directed volley, while the Mandells hurled in a cloud of spears and arrows. But the Sunlanders cast their flaming blankets from them as they ran, and it was seen that each bore on his shoulders a small pack of ammunition. Of all their possessions, they had chosen to save that. Running swiftly and with purpose, they broke the circle and headed directly for the great cliff, which towered blackly in the brightening day a half-mile to the rear of the village.", "But Tyee knelt on one knee and lined the sights of his rifle on the rearmost Sunlander. A great shout went up when he pulled the trigger and the man fell forward, struggled partly up, and fell again. Without regard for the rain of arrows, another Sunlander ran back, bent over him, and lifted him across his shoulders. But the Mandell spearmen were crowding up into closer range, and a strong cast transfixed the wounded man. He cried out and became swiftly limp as his comrade lowered him to the ground. In the meanwhile, Bill-Man and the three others had made a stand and were driving a leaden hail into the advancing spearmen. The fifth Sunlander bent over his stricken fellow, felt the heart, and then coolly cut the straps of the pack and stood up with the ammunition and extra gun.", "\"Now is he a fool!\" cried Tyee, leaping high, as he ran forward, to clear the squirming body of one of the Hungry Folk.", "His own rifle was clogged so that he could not use it, and he called out for some one to spear the Sunlander, who had turned and was running for safety under the protecting fire. The little old hunter poised his spear on the throwing-stick, swept his arm back as he ran, and delivered the cast.", "\"By the body of the Wolf, say I, it was a good throw!\" Tyee praised, as the fleeing man pitched forward, the spear standing upright between his shoulders and swaying slowly forward and back.", "The little weazened old man coughed and sat down. A streak of red showed on his lips and welled into a thick stream. He coughed again, and a strange whistling came and went with his breath.", "Tyee glanced up. Four Mandells and one of the Hungry Folk had rushed upon the fallen man and were spearing him from his knees back to the earth. In the twinkling of an eye, Tyee saw four of them cut down by the bullets of the Sunlanders. The fifth, as yet unhurt, seized the two rifles, but as he stood up to make off he was whirled almost completely around by the impact of a bullet in the arm, steadied by a second, and overthrown by the shock of a third. A moment later and Bill-Man was on the spot, cutting the pack-straps and picking up the guns.", "This Tyee saw, and his own people falling as they straggled forward, and he was aware of a quick doubt, and resolved to lie where he was and see more. For some unaccountable reason, Mesahchie was running back to Bill-Man; but before she could reach him, Tyee saw Peelo run out and throw arms about her. He essayed to sling her across his shoulder, but she grappled with him, tearing and scratching at his face. Then she tripped him, and the pair fell heavily. When they regained their feet, Peelo had shifted his grip so that one arm was passed under her chin, the wrist pressing into her throat and strangling her. He buried his face in her breast, taking the blows of her hands on his thick mat of hair, and began slowly to force her off the field. Then it was, retreating with the weapons of his fallen comrades, that Bill-Man came upon them. As Mesahchie saw him, she twirled the victim around and held him steady. Bill-Man swung the rifle in his right hand, and hardly easing his stride, delivered the blow. Tyee saw Peelo drive to the earth as smote by a falling star, and the Sunlander and Neegah's daughter fleeing side by side.", "A bunch of Mandells, led by one of the Hungry Folk, made a futile rush which melted away into the earth before the scorching fire.", "\"As I say, they are great fighters,\" the old hunter whispered weakly, far gone in hemorrhage. \"I know. I have heard. They be sea-robbers and hunters of seals; and they shoot quick and true, for it is their way of life and the work of their hands.\"", "\"Like the young frost in the morning sun,\" Tyee repeated, crouching for shelter behind the dying man and peering at intervals about him.", "It was no longer a fight, for no Mandell man dared venture forward, and as it was, they were too close to the Sunlanders to go back. Three tried it, scattering and scurrying like rabbits; but one came down with a broken leg, another was shot through the body, and the third, twisting and dodging, fell on the edge of the village. So the tribesmen crouched in the hollow places and burrowed into the dirt in the open, while the Sunlanders' bullets searched the plain.", "\"Move not,\" Tyee pleaded, as Aab-Waak came worming over the ground to him. \"Move not, good Aab-Waak, else you bring death upon us.\"", "\"Death sits upon many,\" Aab-Waak laughed; \"wherefore, as you say, there will be much wealth in division. My father breathes fast and short behind the big rock yon, and beyond, twisted like in a knot, lieth my brother. But their share shall be my share, and it is well.\"", "\"As you say, good Aab-Waak, and as I have said; but before division must come that which we may divide, and the Sunlanders be not yet dead.\"", "A bullet glanced from a rock before them, and singing shrilly, rose low over their heads on its second flight. Tyee ducked and shivered, but Aab-Waak grinned and sought vainly to follow it with his eyes.", "\"And many be left,\" was the reply. \"And they hug close to the earth, for they have become wise in the fashion of righting. Further, they are angered. Moreover, when we have killed the Sunlanders on the ship, there will remain but four on the land. These may take long to kill, but in the end it will happen.\"", "\"It is a bad place where lie Bill-Man and his brothers,\" Aab-Waak explained. \"We may come upon them from every side, which is not good. So they aim to get their backs against the cliff and wait until their brothers of the ship come to give them aid.\"", "Tyee was gathering courage again, and when the Sunlanders verified the prediction by retreating to the cliff, he was light-hearted as ever.", "\"Ay; and if it should happen that two of you be left, then will you have six guns each. Therefore, fight well.\"", "However, to propitiate the Hungry Folk, he made one of them leader of the ship expedition. This party comprised fully two-thirds of the tribesmen, and departed for the coast, a dozen miles away, laden with skins and things to trade. The remaining men were disposed in a large half-circle about the breastwork which Bill-Man and his Sunlanders had begun to throw up. Tyee was quick to note the virtues of things, and at once set his men to digging shallow trenches.", "\"The time will go before they are aware,\" he explained to Aab-Waak; \"and their minds being busy, they will not think overmuch of the dead that are, nor gather trouble to themselves. And in the dark of night they may creep closer, so that when the Sunlanders look forth in the morning light they will find us very near.\"", "In the midday heat the men ceased from their work and made a meal of dried fish and seal oil which the women brought up. There was some clamor for the food of the Sunlanders in the igloo of Neegah, but Tyee refused to divide it until the return of the ship party. Speculations upon the outcome became rife, but in the midst of it a dull boom drifted up over the land from the sea. The keen-eyed ones made out a dense cloud of smoke, which quickly disappeared, and which they averred was directly over the ship of the Sunlanders. Tyee was of the opinion that it was a big gun. Aab-Waak did not know, but thought it might be a signal of some sort. Anyway, he said, it was time something happened.", "Five or six hours afterward a solitary man was descried coming across the wide flat from the sea, and the women and children poured out upon him in a body. It was Ounenk, naked, winded, and wounded. The blood still trickled down his face from a gash on the forehead. His left arm, frightfully mangled, hung helpless at his side. But most significant of all, there was a wild gleam in his eyes which betokened the women knew not what.", "But he said nothing, brushing his way through the clamorous mass and directing his staggering steps toward Tyee. The old squaw raised the wail, and one by one the women joined her as they swung in behind. The men crawled out of their trenches and ran back to gather about Tyee, and it was noticed that the Sunlanders climbed upon their barricade to see.", "Ounenk halted, swept the blood from his eyes, and looked about. He strove to speak, but his dry lips were glued together. Likeeta fetched him water, and he grunted and drank again.", "\"Ho! ho! ho!\" So suddenly and so fiercely did Ounenk laugh that every voice hushed. \"Never was there such a fight! So I say, I, Ounenk, fighter beforetime of beasts and men. And ere I forget, let me speak fat words and wise. By fighting will the Sunlanders teach us Mandell Folk how to fight. And if we fight long enough, we shall be great fighters, even as the Sunlanders, or else we shall be--dead. Ho! ho! ho! It was a fight!\"", "\"Neither the ship of the Sunlanders, nor the wealth and guns and things,\" was the unvarying response. \"All are not. Nothing is. I only am.\"", "Tyee held his tongue, and all waited till it should please Ounenk to tell the story in his own way.", "\"We took no guns, O Tyee,\" he at last began; \"no guns, my brothers--only knives and hunting bows and spears. And in twos and threes, in our kayaks, we came to the ship. They were glad to see us, the Sunlanders, and we spread our skins and they brought out their articles of trade, and everything was well. And Pome-Lee waited--waited till the sun was well overhead and they sat at meat, when he gave the cry and we fell upon them. Never was there such a fight, and never such fighters. Half did we kill in the quickness of surprise, but the half that was left became as devils, and they multiplied themselves, and everywhere they fought like devils. Three put their backs against the mast of the ship, and we ringed them with our dead before they died. And some got guns and shot with both eyes wide open, and very quick and sure. And one got a big gun, from which at one time he shot many small bullets. And so, behold!\"", "\"But I, Ounenk, drove my spear through his back from behind. And in such fashion, one way and another, did we kill them all--all save the head man. And him we were about, many of us, and he was alone, when he made a great cry and broke through us, five or six dragging upon him, and ran down inside the ship. And then, when the wealth of the ship was ours, and only the head man down below whom we would kill presently, why then there was a sound as of all the guns in the world--a mighty sound! And like a bird I rose up in the air, and the living Mandell Folk, and the dead Sunlanders, the little kayaks, the big ship, the guns, the wealth--everything rose up in the air. So I say, I, Ounenk, who tell the tale, am the only one left.\"", "A great silence fell upon the assemblage. Tyee looked at Aab-Waak with awe-struck eyes, but forbore to speak. Even the women were too stunned to wail the dead.", "But at that instant a rifle cracked from Bill-Man's barricade, and there was a sharp spat and thud on the chest of Ounenk. He swayed backward and came forward again, a look of startled surprise on his face. He gasped, and his lips writhed in a grim smile. There was a shrinking together of the shoulders and a bending of the knees. He shook himself, as might a drowsing man, and straightened up. But the shrinking and bending began again, and he sank down slowly, quite slowly, to the ground.", "It was a clean mile from the pit of the Sunlanders, and death had spanned it. A great cry of rage went up, and in it there was much of blood-vengeance, much of the unreasoned ferocity of the brute. Tyee and Aab-Waak tried to hold the Mandell Folk back, were thrust aside, and could only turn and watch the mad charge. But no shots came from the Sunlanders, and ere half the distance was covered, many, affrighted by the mysterious silence of the pit, halted and waited. The wilder spirits bore on, and when they had cut the remaining distance in half, the pit still showed no sign of life. At two hundred yards they slowed down and bunched; at one hundred, they stopped, a score of them, suspicious, and conferred together.", "Then a wreath of smoke crowned the barricade, and they scattered like a handful of pebbles thrown at random. Four went down, and four more, and they continued swiftly to fall, one and two at a time, till but one remained, and he in full flight with death singing about his ears. It was Nok, a young hunter, long-legged and tall, and he ran as never before. He skimmed across the naked open like a bird, and soared and sailed and curved from side to side. The rifles in the pit rang out in solid volley; they flut-flut-flut-flutted in ragged sequence; and still Nok rose and dipped and rose again unharmed. There was a lull in the firing, as though the Sunlanders had given over, and Nok curved less and less in his flight till he darted straight forward at every leap. And then, as he leaped cleanly and well, one lone rifle barked from the pit, and he doubled up in mid-air, struck the ground in a ball, and like a ball bounced from the impact, and came down in a broken heap.", "Tyee grunted and turned away. The incident was closed and there was more pressing matter at hand. One Hungry Man and forty fighters, some of them hurt, remained; and there were four Sunlanders yet to reckon with.", "\"We will keep them in their hole by the cliff,\" he said, \"and when famine has gripped them hard we will slay them like children.\"", "\"But of what matter to fight?\" queried Oloof, one of the younger men. \"The wealth of the Sunlanders is not; only remains that in the igloo of Neegah, a paltry quantity--\"", "Tyee laughed scornfully. \"Let that be thy answer. What else may we do with this mad breed of Sunlanders which will not die?\"", "\"What a thing is foolishness!\" Oloof protested, his ears furtively alert for the coming of other bullets. \"It is not right that they should fight so, these Sunlanders. Why will they not die easily? They are fools not to know that they are dead men, and they give us much trouble.\"", "That night there was a clash in the trenches, and shots exchanged. And in the morning the igloo of Neegah was found empty of the Sunlanders' possessions. These they themselves had taken, for the signs of their trail were visible to the sun. Oloof climbed to the brow of the cliff to hurl great stones down into the pit, but the cliff overhung, and he hurled down abuse and insult instead, and promised bitter torture to them in the end. Bill-Man mocked him back in the tongue of the Bear Folk, and Tyee, lifting his head from a trench to see, had his shoulder scratched deeply by a bullet.", "And in the dreary days that followed, and in the wild nights when they pushed the trenches closer, there was much discussion as to the wisdom of letting the Sunlanders go. But of this they were afraid, and the women raised a cry always at the thought This much they had seen of the Sunlanders; they cared to see no more. All the time the whistle and blub-blub of bullets filled the air, and all the time the death-list grew. In the golden sunrise came the faint, far crack of a rifle, and a stricken woman would throw up her hands on the distant edge of the village; in the noonday heat, men in the trenches heard the shrill sing-song and knew their deaths; or in the gray afterglow of evening, the dirt kicked up in puffs by the winking fires. And through the nights the long \"Wah-hoo-ha-a wah-hoo-ha-a!\" of mourning women held dolorous sway.", "As Tyee had promised, in the end famine gripped the Sunlanders. And once, when an early fall gale blew, one of them crawled through the darkness past the trenches and stole many dried fish.", "But he could not get back with them, and the sun found him vainly hiding in the village. So he fought the great fight by himself, and in a narrow ring of Mandell Folk shot four with his revolver, and ere they could lay hands on him for the torture, turned it on himself and died.", "This threw a gloom upon the people. Oloof put the question, \"If one man die so hard, how hard will die the three who yet are left?\"", "Then Mesahchie stood up on the barricade and called in by name three dogs which had wandered close,--meat and life,--which set back the day of reckoning and put despair in the hearts of the Mandell Folk. And on the head of Mesahchie were showered the curses of a generation.", "The days dragged by. The sun hurried south, the nights grew long and longer, and there was a touch of frost in the air. And still the Sunlanders held the pit. Hearts were breaking under the unending strain, and Tyee thought hard and deep. Then he sent forth word that all the skins and hides of all the tribe be collected. These he had made into huge cylindrical bales, and behind each bale he placed a man.", "When the word was given the brief day was almost spent, and it was slow work and tedious, rolling the big bales forward foot by foot The bullets of the Sunlanders blub-blubbed and thudded against them, but could not go through, and the men howled their delight But the dark was at hand, and Tyee, secure of success, called the bales back to the trenches.", "In the morning, in the face of an unearthly silence from the pit, the real advance began. At first with large intervals between, the bales slowly converged as the circle drew in. At a hundred yards they were quite close together, so that Tyee's order to halt was passed along in whispers. The pit showed no sign of life. They watched long and sharply, but nothing stirred. The advance was taken up and the manoeuvre repeated at fifty yards. Still no sign nor sound. Tyee shook his head, and even Aab-Waak was dubious. But the order was given to go on, and go on they did, till bale touched bale and a solid rampart of skin and hide bowed out from the cliff about the pit and back to the cliff again.", "Tyee looked back and saw the women and children clustering blackly in the deserted trenches. He looked ahead at the silent pit. The men were wriggling nervously, and he ordered every second bale forward. This double line advanced till bale touched bale as before. Then Aab-Waak, of his own will, pushed one bale forward alone. When it touched the barricade, he waited a long while. After that he tossed unresponsive rocks over into the pit, and finally, with great care, stood up and peered in. A carpet of empty cartridges, a few white-picked dog bones, and a soggy place where water dripped from a crevice, met his eyes. That was all. The Sunlanders were gone.", "There were murmurings of witchcraft, vague complaints, dark looks which foreshadowed to Tyee dread things which yet might come to pass, and he breathed easier when Aab-Waak took up the trail along the base of the cliff.", "The cliff was honey-combed with a labyrinth of subterranean passages which found vent in an opening midway between the pit and where the trench tapped the wall. Thither, and with many exclamations, the tribesmen followed Aab-Waak, and, arrived, they saw plainly where the Sunlanders had climbed to the mouth, twenty and odd feet above.", "\"Now the thing is done,\" Tyee said, rubbing his hands. \"Let word go forth that rejoicing be made, for they are in the trap now, these Sunlanders, in the trap. The young men shall climb up, and the mouth of the cave be filled with stones, so that Bill-Man and his brothers and Mesahchie shall by famine be pinched to shadows and die cursing in the silence and dark.\"", "Cries of delight and relief greeted this, and Howgah, the last of the Hungry Folk, swarmed up the steep slant and drew himself, crouching, upon the lip of the opening. But as he crouched, a muffled report rushed forth, and as he clung desperately to the slippery edge, a second. His grip loosed with reluctant weakness, and he pitched down at the feet of Tyee, quivered for a moment like some monstrous jelly, and was still.", "\"How should I know they were great fighters and unafraid?\" Tyee demanded, spurred to defence by recollection of the dark looks and vague complaints.", "But Oloof cried them cease. \"Give ear, my brothers! There be another way! As a boy I chanced upon it playing along the steep. It is hidden by the rocks, and there is no reason that a man should go there; wherefore it is secret, and no man knows. It is very small, and you crawl on your belly a long way, and then you are in the cave. To-night we will so crawl, without noise, on our bellies, and come upon the Sunlanders from behind. And to-morrow we will be at peace, and never again will we quarrel with the Sunlanders in the years to come.\"", "That night, with the memory of their dead in their hearts, and in their hands stones and spears and knives, the horde of women and children collected about the known mouth of the cave. Down the twenty and odd precarious feet to the ground no Sunlander could hope to pass and live. In the village remained only the wounded men, while every able man--and there were thirty of them--followed Oloof to the secret opening. A hundred feet of broken ledges and insecurely heaped rocks were between it and the earth, and because of the rocks, which might be displaced by the touch of hand or foot, but one man climbed at a time. Oloof went up first, called softly for the next to come on, and disappeared inside. A man followed, a second, and a third, and so on, till only Tyee remained. He received the call of the last man, but a quick doubt assailed him and he stayed to ponder. Half an hour later he swung up to the opening and peered in. He could feel the narrowness of the passage, and the darkness before him took on solidity. The fear of the walled-in earth chilled him and he could not venture. All the men who had died, from Neegah the first of the Mandells, to Howgah the last of the Hungry Folk, came and sat with him, but he chose the terror of their company rather than face the horror which he felt to lurk in the thick blackness. He had been sitting long when something soft and cold fluttered lightly on his cheek, and he knew the first winter's snow was falling. The dim dawn came, and after that the bright day, when he heard a low guttural sobbing, which came and went at intervals along the passage and which drew closer each time and more distinct He slipped over the edge, dropped his feet to the first ledge, and waited.", "That which sobbed made slow progress, but at last, after many halts, it reached him, and he was sure no Sunlander made the noise. So he reached a hand inside, and where there should have been a head felt the shoulders of a man uplifted on bent arms. The head he found later, not erect, but hanging straight down so that the crown rested on the floor of the passage.", "\"Is it you, Tyee?\" the head said. \"For it is I, Aab-Waak, who am helpless and broken as a rough-flung spear. My head is in the dirt, and I may not climb down unaided.\"", "Tyee clambered in, dragged him up with his back against the wall, but the head hung down on the chest and sobbed and wailed.", "\"Ai-oo-o, ai-oo-o!\" it went \"Oloof forgot, for Mesahchie likewise knew the secret and showed the Sunlanders, else they would not have waited at the end of the narrow way. Wherefore, I am a broken man, and helpless--ai-oo-o, ai-oo-o!\"", "\"How should I know they waited?\" Aab-Waak gurgled. \"For my brothers had gone before, many of them, and there was no sound of struggle. How should I know why there should be no sound of struggle? And ere I knew, two hands were about my neck so that I could not cry out and warn my brothers yet to come. And then there were two hands more on my head, and two more on my feet. In this fashion the three Sunlanders had me. And while the hands held my head in the one place, the hands on my feet swung my body around, and as we wring the neck of a duck in the marsh, so my week was wrung.", "\"But it was not given that I should die,\" he went on, a remnant of pride yet glimmering. \"I, only, am left. Oloof and the rest lie on their backs in a row, and their faces turn this way and that, and the faces of some be underneath where the backs of their heads should be. It is not good to look upon; for when life returned to me I saw them all by the light of a torch which the Sunlanders left, and I had been laid with them in the row.\"", "\"It is well,\" it said. \"I look for the man who crawls with the broken neck, and lo, do I find Tyee. Throw down thy gun, Tyee, so that I may hear it strike among the rocks.\"", "Tyee obeyed passively, and Bill-Man crawled forward into the light. Tyee looked at him curiously. He was gaunt and worn and dirty, and his eyes burned like twin coals in their cavernous sockets.", "But Bill-Man had turned and was calling back into the passage. \"Hey! Charley! Jim! Fetch the woman along and come on!\"", "Bill-Man slipped over the edge of the opening and prepared to descend. \"But we come again, Tyee. We come again, and our days shall be long in the land.\"", "And so they departed into the trackless south, Bill-Man, his brothers, and Mesahchie. And when the next year came, the _Search Number Two_ rode at anchor in Mandell Bay. The few Mandell men, who survived because their wounds had prevented their crawling into the cave, went to work at the best of the Sunlanders and dug in the ground. They hunt and fish no more, but receive a daily wage, with which they buy flour, sugar, calico, and such things which the _Search Number Two_ brings on her yearly trip from the Sunlands.", "And this mine is worked in secret, as many Northland mines have been worked; and no white man outside the Company, which is Bill-Man, Jim, and Charley, knows the whereabouts of Mandell on the rim of the polar sea. Aab-Waak still carries his head on one shoulder, is become an oracle, and preaches peace to the younger generation, for which he receives a pension from the Company. Tyee is foreman of the mine. But he has achieved a new theory concerning the Sunlanders.", "\"They that live under the path of the sun are not soft,\" he says, smoking his pipe and watching the day-shift take itself off and the night-shift go on. \"For the sun enters into their blood and burns them with a great fire till they are filled with lusts and passions. They burn always, so that they may not know when they are beaten. Further, there is an unrest in them, which is a devil, and they are flung out over the earth to toil and suffer and fight without end. I know. I am Tyee.\"", "This is a tale that was told to me by two old men. We sat in the smoke of a mosquito-smudge, in the cool of the day, which was midnight; and ever and anon, throughout the telling, we smote lustily and with purpose at such of the winged pests as braved the smoke for a snack at our hides. To the right, beneath us, twenty feet down the crumbling bank, the Yukon gurgled lazily. To the left, on the rose-leaf rim of the low-lying hills, smouldered the sleepy sun, which saw no sleep that night nor was destined to see sleep for many nights to come.", "The old men who sat with me and valorously slew mosquitoes were Lone Chief and Mutsak, erstwhile comrades in arms, and now withered repositories of tradition and ancient happening. They were the last of their generation and without honor among the younger set which had grown up on the farthest fringe of a mining civilization. Who cared for tradition in these days, when spirits could be evoked from black bottles, and black bottles could be evoked from the complaisant white men for a few hours' sweat or a mangy fur? Of what potency the fearful rites and masked mysteries of shamanism, when daily that living wonder, the steamboat, coughed and spluttered up and down the Yukon in defiance of all law, a veritable fire-breathing monster? And of what value was hereditary prestige, when he who now chopped the most wood, or best conned a stern-wheeler through the island mazes, attained the chiefest consideration of his fellows?", "Of a truth, having lived too long, they had fallen on evil days, these two old men, Lone Chief and Mutsak, and in the new order they were without honor or place. So they waited drearily for death, and the while their hearts warmed to the strange white man who shared with them the torments of the mosquito-smudge and lent ready ear to their tales of old time before the steamboat came.", "\"So a girl was chosen for me,\" Lone Chief was saying. His voice, shrill and piping, ever and again dropped plummet-like into a hoarse and rattling bass, and, just as one became accustomed to it, soaring upward into the thin treble--alternate cricket chirpings and bullfrog croakings, as it were.", "\"So a girl was chosen for me,\" he was saying. \"For my father, who was Kask-ta-ka, the Otter, was angered because I looked not with a needful eye upon women. He was an old man, and chief of his tribe. I was the last of his sons to be alive, and through me, only, could he look to see his blood go down among those to come after and as yet unborn. But know, O White Man, that I was very sick; and when neither the hunting nor the fishing delighted me, and by meat my belly was not made warm, how should I look with favor upon women? or prepare for the feast of marriage? or look forward to the prattle and troubles of little children?\"", "\"Ay,\" Mutsak interrupted. \"For had not Lone Chief fought in the arms of a great bear till his head was cracked and blood ran from out his ears?\"", "Lone Chief nodded vigorously. \"Mutsak speaks true. In the time that followed, my head was well, and it was not well. For though the flesh healed and the sore went away, yet was I sick inside. When I walked, my legs shook under me, and when I looked at the light, my eyes became filled with tears. And when I opened my eyes, the world outside went around and around, and when I closed my eyes, my head inside went around and around, and all the things I had ever seen went around and around inside my head. And above my eyes there was a great pain, as though something heavy rested always upon me, or like a band that is drawn tight and gives much hurt. And speech was slow to me, and I waited long for each right word to come to my tongue. And when I waited not long, all manner of words crowded in, and my tongue spoke foolishness. I was very sick, and when my father, the Otter, brought the girl Kasaan before me--\"", "\"Who was a young girl, and strong, my sister's child,\" Mutsak broke in. \"Strong-hipped for children was Kasaan, and straight-legged and quick of foot. She made better moccasins than any of all the young girls, and the bark-rope she braided was the stoutest. And she had a smile in her eyes, and a laugh on her lips; and her temper was not hasty, nor was she unmindful that men give the law and women ever obey.\"", "\"As I say, I was very sick,\" Lone Chief went on. \"And when my father, the Otter, brought the girl Kasaan before me, I said rather should they make me ready for burial than for marriage. Whereat the face of my father went black with anger, and he said that I should be served according to my wish, and that I who was yet alive should be made ready for death as one already dead--\"", "\"Which be not the way of our people, O White Man,\" spoke up Mutsak. \"For know that these things that were done to Lone Chief it was our custom to do only to dead men. But the Otter was very angry.\"", "\"Ay,\" said Lone Chief. \"My father, the Otter, was a man short of speech and swift of deed. And he commanded the people to gather before the lodge wherein I lay. And when they were gathered, he commanded them to mourn for his son who was dead--\"", "\"And before the lodge they sang the death-song--_O-o-o-o-o-o-a-haa-ha-a-ich-klu-kuk-ich-klu-kuk_,\" wailed Mutsak, in so excellent an imitation that all the tendrils of my spine crawled and curved in sympathy.", "\"And inside the lodge,\" continued Lone Chief, \"my mother blackened her face with soot, and flung ashes upon her head, and mourned for me as one already dead; for so had my father commanded. So Okiakuta, my mother, mourned with much noise, and beat her breasts and tore her hair; and likewise Hooniak, my sister, and Seenatah, my mother's sister; and the noise they made caused a great ache in my head, and I felt that I would surely and immediately die.", "\"And the elders of the tribe gathered about me where I lay and discussed the journey my soul must take. One spoke of the thick and endless forests where lost souls wandered crying, and where I, too, might chance to wander and never see the end. And another spoke of the big rivers, rapid with bad water, where evil spirits shrieked and lifted up their formless arms to drag one down by the hair. For these rivers, all said together, a canoe must be provided me. And yet another spoke of the storms, such as no live man ever saw, when the stars rained down out of the sky, and the earth gaped wide in many cracks, and all the rivers in the heart of the earth rushed out and in. Whereupon they that sat by me flung up their arms and wailed loudly; and those outside heard, and wailed more loudly. And as to them I was as dead, so was I to my own mind dead. I did not know when, or how, yet did I know that I had surely died.", "\"And Okiakuta, my mother, laid beside me my squirrel-skin parka. Also she laid beside me my parka of caribou hide, and my rain coat of seal gut, and my wet-weather muclucs, that my soul should be warm and dry on its long journey. Further, there was mention made of a steep hill, thick with briers and devil's-club, and she fetched heavy moccasins to make the way easy for my feet.", "\"And when the elders spoke of the great beasts I should have to slay, the young men laid beside me my strongest bow and straightest arrows, my throwing-stick, my spear and knife. And when the elders spoke of the darkness and silence of the great spaces my soul must wander through, my mother wailed yet more loudly and flung yet more ashes upon her head.", "\"And the girl, Kasaan, crept in, very timid and quiet, and dropped a little bag upon the things for my journey. And in the little bag, I knew, were the flint and steel and the well-dried tinder for the fires my soul must build. And the blankets were chosen which were to be wrapped around me. Also were the slaves selected that were to be killed that my soul might have company. There were seven of these slaves, for my father was rich and powerful, and it was fit that I, his son, should have proper burial. These slaves we had got in war from the Mukumuks, who live down the Yukon. On the morrow, Skolka, the shaman, would kill them, one by one, so that their souls should go questing with mine through the Unknown. Among other things, they would carry my canoe till we came to the big river, rapid with bad water. And there being no room, and their work being done, they would come no farther, but remain and howl forever in the dark and endless forest.", "\"And as I looked on my fine warm clothes, and my blankets and weapons of war, and as I thought of the seven slaves to be slain, I felt proud of my burial and knew that I must be the envy of many men. And all the while my father, the Otter, sat silent and black. And all that day and night the people sang my death-song and beat the drums, till it seemed that I had surely died a thousand times.", "\"But in the morning my father arose and made talk. He had been a fighting man all his days, he said, as the people knew. Also the people knew that it were a greater honor to die fighting in battle than on the soft skins by the fire. And since I was to die anyway, it were well that I should go against the Mukumuks and be slain. Thus would I attain honor and chieftainship in the final abode of the dead, and thus would honor remain to my father, who was the Otter. Wherefore he gave command that a war party be made ready to go down the river. And that when we came upon the Mukumuks I was to go forth alone from my party, giving semblance of battle, and so be slain.\"", "\"Nay, but hear, O White Man!\" cried Mutsak, unable longer to contain himself. \"Skolka, the shaman, whispered long that night in the ear of the Otter, and it was his doing that Lone Chief should be sent forth to die. For the Otter being old, and Lone Chief the last of his sons, Skolka had it in mind to become chief himself over the people. And when the people had made great noise for a day and a night and Lone Chief was yet alive, Skolka was become afraid that he would not die. So it was the counsel of Skolka, with fine words of honor and deeds, that spoke through the mouth of the Otter.", "\"Ay,\" replied Lone Chief. \"Well did I know it was the doing of Skolka, but I was unmindful, being very sick. I had no heart for anger, nor belly for stout words, and I cared little, one way or the other, only I cared to die and have done with it all. So, O White Man, the war party was made ready. No tried fighters were there, nor elders, crafty and wise--naught but five score of young men who had seen little fighting. And all the village gathered together above the bank of the river to see us depart. And we departed amid great rejoicing and the singing of my praises. Even thou, O White Man, wouldst rejoice at sight of a young man going forth to battle, even though doomed to die.", "\"So we went forth, the five score young men, and Mutsak came also, for he was likewise young and untried. And by command of my father, the Otter, my canoe was lashed on either side to the canoe of Mutsak and the canoe of Kannakut. Thus was my strength saved me from the work of the paddles, so that, for all of my sickness, I might make a brave show at the end. And thus we went down the river.", "\"Nor will I weary thee with the tale of the journey, which was not long. And not far above the village of the Mukumuks we came upon two of their fighting men in canoes, that fled at the sight of us. And then, according to the command of my father, my canoe was cast loose and I was left to drift down all alone. Also, according to his command, were the young men to see me die, so that they might return and tell the manner of my death. Upon this, my father, the Otter, and Skolka, the shaman, had been very clear, with stern promises of punishment in case they were not obeyed.", "\"I dipped my paddle and shouted words of scorn after the fleeing warriors. And the vile things I shouted made them turn their heads in anger, when they beheld that the young men held back, and that I came on alone. Whereupon, when they had made a safe distance, the two warriors drew their canoes somewhat apart and waited side by side for me to come between. And I came between, spear in hand, and singing the war-song of my people. Each flung a spear, but I bent my body, and the spears whistled over me, and I was unhurt. Then, and we were all together, we three, I cast my spear at the one to the right, and it drove into his throat and he pitched backward into the water.", "\"Great was my surprise thereat, for I had killed a man. I turned to the one on the left and drove strong with my paddle, to meet Death face to face; but the man's second spear, which was his last, but bit into the flesh of my shoulder. Then was I upon him, making no cast, but pressing the point into his breast and working it through him with both my hands. And while I worked, pressing with all my strength, he smote me upon my head, once and twice, with the broad of his paddle.", "\"Even as the point of the spear sprang out beyond his back, he smote me upon the head. There was a flash, as of bright light, and inside my head I felt something give, with a snap--just like that, with a snap. And the weight that pressed above my eyes so long was lifted, and the band that bound my brows so tight was broken. And a great gladness came upon me, and my heart sang with joy.", "\"This be death, I thought; wherefore I thought that death was very good. And then I saw the two empty canoes, and I knew that I was not dead, but well again. The blows of the man upon my head had made me well. I knew that I had killed, and the taste of the blood made me fierce, and I drove my paddle into the breast of the Yukon and urged my canoe toward the village of the Mukumuks. The young men behind me gave a great cry. I looked over my shoulder and saw the water foaming white from their paddles--\"", "\"Ay, it foamed white from our paddles,\" said Mutsak. \"For we remembered the command of the Otter, and of Skolka, that we behold with our own eyes the manner of Lone Chief's death. A young man of the Mukumuks, on his way to a salmon trap, beheld the coming of Lone Chief, and of the five score men behind him. And the young man fled in his canoe, straight for the village, that alarm might be given and preparation made. But Lone Chief hurried after him, and we hurried after Lone Chief to behold the manner of his death. Only, in the face of the village, as the young man leaped to the shore, Lone Chief rose up in his canoe and made a mighty cast. And the spear entered the body of the young man above the hips, and the young man fell upon his face.", "\"Whereupon Lone Chief leaped up the bank war-club in hand and a great war-cry on his lips, and dashed into the village. The first man he met was Itwilie, chief over the Mukumuks, and him Lone Chief smote upon the head with his war-club, so that he fell dead upon the ground. And for fear we might not behold the manner of his death, we too, the five score young men, leaped to the shore and followed Lone Chief into the village. Only the Mukumuks did not understand, and thought we had come to fight; so their bow-thongs sang and their arrows whistled among us. Whereat we forgot our errand, and fell upon them with our spears and clubs; and they being unprepared, there was great slaughter--\"", "\"With my own hands I slew their shaman,\" proclaimed Lone Chief, his withered face a-work with memory of that old-time day. \"With my own hands I slew him, who was a greater shaman than Skolka, our own shaman. And each time I faced a man, I thought, 'Now cometh Death; and each time I slew the man, and Death came not. It seemed the breath of life was strong in my nostrils and I could not die--\"", "\"And we followed Lone Chief the length of the village and back again,\" continued Mutsak. \"Like a pack of wolves we followed him, back and forth, and here and there, till there were no more Mukumuks left to fight. Then we gathered together five score men-slaves, and double as many women, and countless children, and we set fire and burned all the houses and lodges, and departed. And that was the last of the Mukumuks.\"", "\"And that was the last of the Mukumuks,\" Lone Chief repeated exultantly. \"And when we came to our own village, the people were amazed at our burden of wealth and slaves, and in that I was still alive they were more amazed. And my father, the Otter, came trembling with gladness at the things I had done. For he was an old man, and I the last of his sons. And all the tried fighting men came, and the crafty and wise, till all the people were gathered together. And then I arose, and with a voice like thunder, commanded Skolka, the shaman, to stand forth--\"", "\"Ay, O White Man,\" exclaimed Mutsak. \"With a voice like thunder, that made the people shake at the knees and become afraid.\"", "\"And when Skolka had stood forth,\" Lone Chief went on, \"I said that I was not minded to die. Also, I said it were not well that disappointment come to the evil spirits that wait beyond the grave. Wherefore I deemed it fit that the soul of Skolka fare forth into the Unknown, where doubtless it would howl forever in the dark and endless forest. And then I slew him, as he stood there, in the face of all the people. Even I, Lone Chief, with my own hands, slew Skolka, the shaman, in the face of all the people. And when a murmuring arose, I cried aloud--\"", "\"Ay, with a voice like thunder I cried aloud: 'Behold, O ye people! I am Lone Chief, slayer of Skolka, the false shaman! Alone among men, have I passed down through the gateway of Death and returned again. Mine eyes have looked upon the unseen things. Mine ears have heard the unspoken words. Greater am I than Skolka, the shaman. Greater than all shamans am I. Likewise am I a greater chief than my father, the Otter. All his days did he fight with the Mukumuks, and lo, in one day have I destroyed them all. As with the breathing of a breath have I destroyed them. Wherefore, my father, the Otter, being old, and Skolka, the shaman, being dead, I shall be both chief and shaman. Henceforth shall I be both chief and shaman to you, O my people. And if any man dispute my word, let that man stand forth!'", "\"I waited, but no man stood forth. Then I cried: 'Hoh! I have tasted blood! Now bring meat, for I am hungry. Break open the caches, tear down the fish-racks, and let the feast be big. Let there be merriment, and songs, not of burial, but marriage. And last of all, let the girl Kasaan be brought. The girl Kasaan, who is to be the mother of the children of Lone Chief!'", "\"And at my words, and because that he was very old, my father, the Otter, wept like a woman, and put his arms about my knees. And from that day I was both chief and shaman. And great honor was mine, and all men yielded me obedience.\"", "\"Thus will I give six blankets, warm and double; six files, large and hard; six Hudson Bay knives, keen-edged and long; two canoes, the work of Mogum, The Maker of Things; ten dogs, heavy-shouldered and strong in the harness; and three guns--the trigger of one be broken, but it is a good gun and can doubtless be mended.\"", "Keesh paused and swept his eyes over the circle of intent faces. It was the time of the Great Fishing, and he was bidding to Gnob for Su-Su his daughter. The place was the St. George Mission by the Yukon, and the tribes had gathered for many a hundred miles. From north, south, east, and west they had come, even from Tozikakat and far Tana-naw.", "\"And further, O Gnob, thou art chief of the Tana-naw; and I, Keesh, the son of Keesh, am chief of the Thlunget. Wherefore, when my seed springs from the loins of thy daughter, there shall be a friendship between the tribes, a great friendship, and Tana-naw and Thlunget shall be brothers of the blood in the time to come. What I have said I will do, that will I do. And how is it with you, O Gnob, in this matter?\"", "Gnob nodded his head gravely, his gnarled and age-twisted face inscrutably masking the soul that dwelt behind. His narrow eyes burned like twin coals through their narrow slits, as he piped in a high-cracked voice, \"But that is not all.\"", "\"What more?\" Keesh demanded. \"Have I not offered full measure? Was there ever yet a Tana-naw maiden who fetched so great a price? Then name her!\"", "\"Nay, nay, good Keesh, thou dost not understand.\" Gnob made a soft, stroking gesture. \"The price is fair. It is a good price. Nor do I question the broken trigger. But that is not all. What of the man?\"", "\"It is said,\" Gnob's shrill voice piped, \"it is said that Keesh does not walk in the way of his fathers. It is said that he has wandered into the dark, after strange gods, and that he is become afraid.\"", "\"It is said,\" old Gnob piped on, \"that he has harkened to the speech of the white man up at the Big House, and that he bends head to the white man's god, and, moreover, that blood is displeasing to the white man's god.\"", "Keesh dropped his eyes, and his hands clenched passionately. The savage circle laughed derisively, and in the ear of Gnob whispered Madwan, the shaman, high-priest of the tribe and maker of medicine.", "The shaman poked among the shadows on the rim of the firelight and roused up a slender young boy, whom he brought face to face with Keesh; and in the hand of Keesh he thrust a knife.", "Gnob leaned forward. \"Keesh! O Keesh! Darest thou to kill a man? Behold! This be Kitz-noo, a slave. Strike, O Keesh, strike with the strength of thy arm!\"", "The boy trembled and waited the stroke. Keesh looked at him, and thoughts of Mr. Brown's higher morality floated through his mind, and strong upon him was a vision of the leaping flames of Mr. Brown's particular brand of hell-fire. The knife fell to the ground, and the boy sighed and went out beyond the firelight with shaking knees. At the feet of Gnob sprawled a wolf-dog, which bared its gleaming teeth and prepared to spring after the boy. But the shaman ground his foot into the brute's body, and so doing, gave Gnob an idea.", "\"And then, O Keesh, what wouldst thou do, should a man do this thing to you?\"--as he spoke, Gnob held a ribbon of salmon to White Fang, and when the animal attempted to take it, smote him sharply on the nose with a stick. \"And afterward, O Keesh, wouldst thou do thus?\"--White Fang was cringing back on his belly and fawning to the hand of Gnob.", "\"Listen!\"--leaning on the arm of Madwan, Gnob had risen to his feet. \"I am very old, and because I am very old I will tell thee things. Thy father, Keesh, was a mighty man. And he did love the song of the bowstring in battle, and these eyes have beheld him cast a spear till the head stood out beyond a man's body. But thou art unlike. Since thou left the Raven to worship the Wolf, thou art become afraid of blood, and thou makest thy people afraid. This is not good. For behold, when I was a boy, even as Kitz-noo there, there was no white man in all the land. But they came, one by one, these white men, till now they are many. And they are a restless breed, never content to rest by the fire with a full belly and let the morrow bring its own meat. A curse was laid upon them, it would seem, and they must work it out in toil and hardship.\"", "Keesh was startled. A recollection of a hazy story told by Mr. Brown of one Adam, of old time, came to him, and it seemed that Mr. Brown had spoken true.", "\"So they lay hands upon all they behold, these white men, and they go everywhere and behold all things. And ever do more follow in their steps, so that if nothing be done they will come to possess all the land and there will be no room for the tribes of the Raven. Wherefore it is meet that we fight with them till none are left. Then will we hold the passes and the land, and perhaps our children and our children's children shall flourish and grow fat. There is a great struggle to come, when Wolf and Raven shall grapple; but Keesh will not fight, nor will he let his people fight. So it is not well that he should take to him my daughter. Thus have I spoken, I, Gnob, chief of the Tana-naw.\"", "\"But the white men are good and great,\" Keesh made answer. \"The white men have taught us many things. The white men have given us blankets and knives and guns, such as we have never made and never could make. I remember in what manner we lived before they came. I was unborn then, but I have it from my father. When we went on the hunt we must creep so close to the moose that a spear-cast would cover the distance. To-day we use the white man's rifle, and farther away than can a child's cry be heard. We ate fish and meat and berries--there was nothing else to eat--and we ate without salt. How many be there among you who care to go back to the fish and meat without salt?\"", "It would have sunk home, had not Madwan leaped to his feet ere silence could come. \"And first a question to thee, Keesh. The white man up at the Big House tells you that it is wrong to kill. Yet do we not know that the white men kill? Have we forgotten the great fight on the Koyokuk? or the great fight at Nuklukyeto, where three white men killed twenty of the Tozikakats? Do you think we no longer remember the three men of the Tana-naw that the white man Macklewrath killed? Tell me, O Keesh, why does the Shaman Brown teach you that it is wrong to fight, when all his brothers fight?\"", "\"Nay, nay, there is no need to answer,\" Gnob piped, while Keesh struggled with the paradox. \"It is very simple. The Good Man Brown would hold the Raven tight whilst his brothers pluck the feathers.\" He raised his voice. \"But so long as there is one Tana-naw to strike a blow, or one maiden to bear a man-child, the Raven shall not be plucked!\"", "Gnob turned to a husky young man across the fire. \"And what sayest thou, Makamuk, who art brother to Su-Su?\"", "Makamuk came to his feet. A long face-scar lifted his upper lip into a perpetual grin which belied the glowing ferocity of his eyes. \"This day,\" he began with cunning irrelevance, \"I came by the Trader Macklewrath's cabin. And in the door I saw a child laughing at the sun. And the child looked at me with the Trader Macklewrath's eyes, and it was frightened. The mother ran to it and quieted it. The mother was Ziska, the Thlunget woman.\"", "A snarl of rage rose up and drowned his voice, which he stilled by turning dramatically upon Keesh with outstretched arm and accusing finger.", "\"So? You give your women away, you Thlunget, and come to the Tana-naw for more? But we have need of our women, Keesh; for we must breed men, many men, against the day when the Raven grapples with the Wolf.\"", "The young fellow was slender and graceful, with the strong aquiline nose and high brows of his type; but from some nervous affliction the lid of one eye drooped at odd times in a suggestive wink. Even as he arose it so drooped and rested a moment against his cheek. But it was not greeted with the accustomed laughter. Every face was grave. \"I, too, passed by the Trader Macklewrath's cabin,\" he rippled in soft, girlish tones, wherein there was much of youth and much of his sister. \"And I saw Indians with the sweat running into their eyes and their knees shaking with weariness--I say, I saw Indians groaning under the logs for the store which the Trader Macklewrath is to build. And with my eyes I saw them chopping wood to keep the Shaman Brown's Big House warm through the frost of the long nights. This be squaw work. Never shall the Tana-naw do the like. We shall be blood brothers to men, not squaws; and the Thlunget be squaws.\"", "A deep silence fell, and all eyes centred on Keesh. He looked about him carefully, deliberately, full into the face of each grown man. \"So,\" he said passionlessly. And \"So,\" he repeated. Then turned on his heel without further word and passed out into the darkness.", "Wading among sprawling babies and bristling wolf-dogs, he threaded the great camp, and on its outskirts came upon a woman at work by the light of a fire. With strings of bark stripped from the long roots of creeping vines, she was braiding rope for the Fishing. For some time, without speech, he watched her deft hands bringing law and order out of the unruly mass of curling fibres. She was good to look upon, swaying there to her task, strong-limbed, deep-chested, and with hips made for motherhood. And the bronze of her face was golden in the flickering light, her hair blue-black, her eyes jet.", "\"O Su-Su,\" he spoke finally, \"thou hast looked upon me kindly in the days that have gone and in the days yet young--\"", "\"I looked kindly upon thee for that thou wert chief of the Thlunget,\" she answered quickly, \"and because thou wert big and strong.\"", "\"But that was in the old days of the Fishing,\" she hastened to add, \"before the Shaman Brown came and taught thee ill things and led thy feet on strange trails.\"", "She held up one hand in a gesture which reminded him of her father. \"Nay, I know already the speech that stirs in thy throat, O Keesh, and I make answer now. It so happeneth that the fish of the water and the beasts of the forest bring forth after their kind. And this is good. Likewise it happeneth to women. It is for them to bring forth their kind, and even the maiden, while she is yet a maiden, feels the pang of the birth, and the pain of the breast, and the small hands at the neck. And when such feeling is strong, then does each maiden look about her with secret eyes for the man--for the man who shall be fit to father her kind. So have I felt. So did I feel when I looked upon thee and found thee big and strong, a hunter and fighter of beasts and men, well able to win meat when I should eat for two, well able to keep danger afar off when my helplessness drew nigh. But that was before the day the Shaman Brown came into the land and taught thee--\"", "\"It is not right to kill. I know what thou wouldst say. Then breed thou after thy kind, the kind that does not kill; but come not on such quest among the Tana-naw. For it is said in the time to come, that the Raven shall grapple with the Wolf. I do not know, for this be the affair of men; but I do know that it is for me to bring forth men against that time.\"", "\"A _man_ would beat me with a stick and make me hear,\" she sneered. \"But thou ... here!\" She thrust a bunch of bark into his hand. \"I cannot give thee myself, but this, yes. It looks fittest in thy hands. It is squaw work, so braid away.\"", "\"One thing more,\" she went on. \"There be an old custom which thy father and mine were not strangers to. When a man falls in battle, his scalp is carried away in token. Very good. But thou, who have forsworn the Raven, must do more. Thou must bring me, not scalps, but heads, two heads, and then will I give thee, not bark, but a brave-beaded belt, and sheath, and long Russian knife. Then will I look kindly upon thee once again, and all will be well.\"", "But Keesh remained true to his conversion, lived uprightly, and made his tribespeople obey the gospel as propounded by the Rev. Jackson Brown. Through all the time of the Fishing he gave no heed to the Tana-naw, nor took notice of the sly things which were said, nor of the laughter of the women of the many tribes. After the Fishing, Gnob and his people, with great store of salmon, sun-dried and smoke-cured, departed for the Hunting on the head reaches of the Tana-naw. Keesh watched them go, but did not fail in his attendance at Mission service, where he prayed regularly and led the singing with his deep bass voice.", "The Rev. Jackson Brown delighted in that deep bass voice, and because of his sterling qualities deemed him the most promising convert. Macklewrath doubted this. He did not believe in the efficacy of the conversion of the heathen, and he was not slow in speaking his mind. But Mr. Brown was a large man, in his way, and he argued it out with such convincingness, all of one long fall night, that the trader, driven from position after position, finally announced in desperation, \"Knock out my brains with apples, Brown, if I don't become a convert myself, if Keesh holds fast, true blue, for two years!\" Mr. Brown never lost an opportunity, so he clinched the matter on the spot with a virile hand-grip, and thenceforth the conduct of Keesh was to determine the ultimate abiding-place of Macklewrath's soul.", "But there came news one day, after the winter's rime had settled down over the land sufficiently for travel. A Tana-naw man arrived at the St. George Mission in quest of ammunition and bringing information that Su-Su had set eyes on Nee-Koo, a nervy young hunter who had bid brilliantly for her by old Gnob's fire. It was at about this time that the Rev. Jackson Brown came upon Keesh by the wood-trail which leads down to the river. Keesh had his best dogs in the harness, and shoved under the sled-lashings was his largest and finest pair of snow-shoes.", "Keesh looked him steadily in the eyes for a full minute, then started up his dogs. Then again, turning his deliberate gaze upon the missionary, he answered, \"No; I go to hell.\"", "In an open space, striving to burrow into the snow as though for shelter from the appalling desolateness, huddled three dreary lodges. Ringed all about, a dozen paces away, was the sombre forest. Overhead there was no keen, blue sky of naked space, but a vague, misty curtain, pregnant with snow, which had drawn between. There was no wind, no sound, nothing but the snow and silence. Nor was there even the general stir of life about the camp; for the hunting party had run upon the flank of the caribou herd and the kill had been large. Thus, after the period of fasting had come the plenitude of feasting, and thus, in broad daylight, they slept heavily under their roofs of moosehide.", "By a fire, before one of the lodges, five pairs of snow-shoes stood on end in their element, and by the fire sat Su-Su. The hood of her squirrel-skin parka was about her hair, and well drawn up around her throat; but her hands were unmittened and nimbly at work with needle and sinew, completing the last fantastic design on a belt of leather faced with bright scarlet cloth. A dog, somewhere at the rear of one of the lodges, raised a short, sharp bark, then ceased as abruptly as it had begun. Once, her father, in the lodge at her back, gurgled and grunted in his sleep. \"Bad dreams,\" she smiled to herself. \"He grows old, and that last joint was too much.\"", "She placed the last bead, knotted the sinew, and replenished the fire. Then, after gazing long into the flames, she lifted her head to the harsh _crunch-crunch_ of a moccasined foot against the flinty snow granules. Keesh was at her side, bending slightly forward to a load which he bore upon his back. This was wrapped loosely in a soft-tanned moosehide, and he dropped it carelessly into the snow and sat down. They looked at each other long and without speech.", "\"It is a far fetch, O Keesh,\" she said at last, \"a far fetch from St. George Mission by the Yukon.\"", "\"Ay,\" he made answer, absently, his eyes fixed keenly upon the belt and taking note of its girth. \"But where is the knife?\" he demanded.", "\"Here.\" She drew it from inside her parka and flashed its naked length in the firelight. \"It is a good knife.\"", "But her eyes, glancing coquettishly past him to the moosehide, saw the snow about it slowly reddening. \"It is blood, Keesh?\" she asked.", "She felt suddenly afraid, but thrilled when he took the belt roughly from her, thrilled to the roughness. She looked at him softly, and was aware of a pain at the breast and of small hands clutching her throat.", "\"It was made for a smaller man,\" he remarked grimly, drawing in his abdomen and clasping the buckle at the first hole.", "Su-Su smiled, and her eyes were yet softer. Again she felt the soft hands at her throat. He was good to look upon, and the belt was indeed small, made for a smaller man; but what did it matter? She could make many belts.", "\"But the blood?\" she asked, urged on by a hope new-born and growing. \"The blood, Keesh? Is it ... are they ... heads?\"", "But she sat transfixed. There they lay--the soft-featured Nee-Koo; the gnarled old face of Gnob; Makamuk, grinning at her with his lifted upper lip; and lastly, Nossabok, his eyelid, up to its old trick, drooped on his girlish cheek in a suggestive wink. There they lay, the firelight flashing upon and playing over them, and from each of them a widening circle dyed the snow to scarlet.", "Thawed by the fire, the white crust gave way beneath the head of Gnob, which rolled over like a thing alive, spun around, and came to rest at her feet. But she did not move. Keesh, too, sat motionless, his eyes unblinking, centred steadfastly upon her.", "Once, in the forest, an overburdened pine dropped its load of snow, and the echoes reverberated hollowly down the gorge; but neither stirred. The short day had been waning fast, and darkness was wrapping round the camp when White Fang trotted up toward the fire. He paused to reconnoitre, but not being driven back, came closer. His nose shot swiftly to the side, nostrils a-tremble and bristles rising along the spine; and straight and true, he followed the sudden scent to his master's head. He sniffed it gingerly at first and licked the forehead with his red lolling tongue. Then he sat abruptly down, pointed his nose up at the first faint star, and raised the long wolf-howl.", "This brought Su-Su to herself. She glanced across at Keesh, who had unsheathed the Russian knife and was watching her intently. His face was firm and set, and in it she read the law. Slipping back the hood of her parka, she bared her neck and rose to her feet There she paused and took a long look about her, at the rimming forest, at the faint stars in the sky, at the camp, at the snow-shoes in the snow--a last long comprehensive look at life. A light breeze stirred her hair from the side, and for the space of one deep breath she turned her head and followed it around until she met it full-faced.", "Then she thought of her children, ever to be unborn, and she walked over to Keesh and said, \"I am ready.\"", "The speaker ceased, or rather suspended utterance, and gazed upon me with an eye of understanding. I held the bottle between our eyes and the fire, indicated with my thumb the depth of the draught, and shoved it over to him; for was he not Palitlum, the Drinker? Many tales had he told me, and long had I waited for this scriptless scribe to speak of the things concerning Ligoun; for he, of all men living, knew these things best.", "He tilted back his head with a grunt that slid swiftly into a gurgle, and the shadow of a man's torso, monstrous beneath a huge inverted bottle, wavered and danced on the frown of the cliff at our backs. Palitlum released his lips from the glass with a caressing suck and glanced regretfully up into the ghostly vault of the sky where played the wan white light of the summer borealis.", "\"It be strange,\" he said; \"cold like water and hot like fire. To the drinker it giveth strength, and from the drinker it taketh away strength. It maketh old men young, and young men old. To the man who is weary it leadeth him to get up and go onward, and to the man unweary it burdeneth him into sleep. My brother was possessed of the heart of a rabbit, yet did he drink of it, and forthwith slay four of his enemies. My father was like a great wolf, showing his teeth to all men, yet did he drink of it and was shot through the back, running swiftly away. It be most strange.\"", "\"It is 'Three Star,' and a better than what they poison their bellies with down there,\" I answered, sweeping my hand, as it were, over the yawning chasm of blackness and down to where the beach fires glinted far below--tiny jets of flame which gave proportion and reality to the night.", "And here he embraced the bottle and me in a look which told more eloquently than speech of his shameless thirst.", "\"Nay,\" I said, snuggling the bottle in between my knees. \"Speak now of Ligoun. Of the 'Three Star' we will hold speech hereafter.\"", "\"There be plenty, and I am not wearied,\" he pleaded brazenly. \"But the feel of it on my lips, and I will speak great words of Ligoun and his last days.\"", "\"Thou art wise,\" he rejoined, without anger and pridelessly. \"Like all of thy brothers, thou art wise. Waking or sleeping, the 'Three Star' be with thee, yet never have I known thee to drink overlong or overmuch. And the while you gather to you the gold that hides in our mountains and the fish that swim in our seas; and Palitlum, and the brothers of Palitlum, dig the gold for thee and net the fish, and are glad to be made glad when out of thy wisdom thou deemest it fit that the 'Three Star' should wet our lips.\"", "\"I was minded to hear of Ligoun,\" I said impatiently. \"The night grows short, and we have a sore journey to-morrow.\"", "\"It was Ligoun's desire, in his old age, that peace should be among the tribes. As a young man he had been first of the fighting men and chief over the war-chiefs of the Islands and the Passes. All his days had been full of fighting. More marks he boasted of bone and lead and iron than any other man. Three wives he had, and for each wife two sons; and the sons, eldest born and last and all died by his side in battle. Restless as the bald-face, he ranged wide and far--north to Unalaska and the Shallow Sea; south to the Queen Charlottes, ay, even did he go with the Kakes, it is told, to far Puget Sound, and slay thy brothers in their sheltered houses.", "\"But, as I say, in his old age he looked for peace among the tribes. Not that he was become afraid, or overfond of the corner by the fire and the well-filled pot. For he slew with the shrewdness and blood-hunger of the fiercest, drew in his belly to famine with the youngest, and with the stoutest faced the bitter seas and stinging trail. But because of his many deeds, and in punishment, a warship carried him away, even to thy country, O Hair-Face and Boston Man; and the years were many ere he came back, and I was grown to something more than a boy and something less than a young man. And Ligoun, being childless in his old age, made much of me, and grown wise, gave me of his wisdom.", "\"'It be good to fight, O Palitlum,' said he. Nay, O Hair-Face, for I was unknown as Palitlum in those days, being called Olo, the Ever-Hungry. The drink was to come after. 'It be good to fight,' spoke Ligoun, 'but it be foolish. In the Boston Man Country, as I saw with mine eyes, they are not given to fighting one with another, and they be strong. Wherefore, of their strength, they come against us of the Islands and Passes, and we are as camp smoke and sea mist before them. Wherefore I say it be good to fight, most good, but it be likewise foolish.'", "\"And because of this, though first always of the fighting men, Ligoun's voice was loudest, ever, for peace. And when he was very old, being greatest of chiefs and richest of men, he gave a potlatch. Never was there such a potlatch. Five hundred canoes were lined against the river bank, and in each canoe there came not less than ten of men and women. Eight tribes were there; from the first and oldest man to the last and youngest babe were they there. And then there were men from far-distant tribes, great travellers and seekers who had heard of the potlatch of Ligoun. And for the length of seven days they filled their bellies with his meat and drink. Eight thousand blankets did he give to them, as I well know, for who but I kept the tally and apportioned according to degree and rank? And in the end Ligoun was a poor man; but his name was on all men's lips, and other chiefs gritted their teeth in envy that he should be so great.", "\"And so, because there was weight to his words, he counselled peace; and he journeyed to every potlatch and feast and tribal gathering that he might counsel peace. And so it came that we journeyed together, Ligoun and I, to the great feast given by Niblack, who was chief over the river Indians of the Skoot, which is not far from the Stickeen. This was in the last days, and Ligoun was very old and very close to death. He coughed of cold weather and camp smoke, and often the red blood ran from out his mouth till we looked for him to die.", "\"'Nay,' he said once at such time; 'it were better that I should die when the blood leaps to the knife, and there is a clash of steel and smell of powder, and men crying aloud what of the cold iron and quick lead.' So, it be plain, O Hair-Face, that his heart was yet strong for battle.", "\"It is very far from the Chilcat to the Skoot, and we were many days in the canoes. And the while the men bent to the paddles, I sat at the feet of Ligoun and received the Law. Of small need for me to say the Law, O Hair-Face, for it be known to me that in this thou art well skilled. Yet do I speak of the Law of blood for blood, and rank for rank. Also did Ligoun go deeper into the matter, saying:--", "\"'But know this, O Olo, that there be little honor in the killing of a man less than thee. Kill always the man who is greater, and thy honor shall be according to his greatness. But if, of two men, thou killest the lesser, then is shame thine, for which the very squaws will lift their lips at thee. As I say, peace be good; but remember, O Olo, if kill thou must, that thou killest by the Law.'", "And I remembered the gun-fighters and bad men of my own Western land, and was not perplexed at the way of the Thlinket-folk.", "\"In time,\" Palitlum continued, \"we came to Chief Niblack and the Skoots. It was a feast great almost as the potlatch of Ligoun. There were we of the Chilcat, and the Sitkas, and the Stickeens who are neighbors to the Skoots, and the Wrangels and the Hoonahs. There were Sundowns and Tahkos from Port Houghton, and their neighbors the Awks from Douglass Channel; the Naass River people, and the Tongas from north of Dixon, and the Kakes who come from the island called Kupreanoff. Then there were Siwashes from Vancouver, Cassiars from the Gold Mountains, Teslin men, and even Sticks from the Yukon Country.", "\"It was a mighty gathering. But first of all, there was to be a meeting of the chiefs with Niblack, and a drowning of all enmities in quass. The Russians it was who showed us the way of making quass, for so my father told me,--my father, who got it from his father before him. But to this quass had Niblack added many things, such as sugar, flour, dried apples, and hops, so that it was a man's drink, strong and good. Not so good as 'Three Star,' O Hair-Face, yet good.", "\"This quass-feast was for the chiefs, and the chiefs only, and there was a score of them. But Ligoun being very old and very great, it was given that I walk with him that he might lean upon my shoulder and that I might ease him down when he took his seat and raise him up when he arose. At the door of Niblack's house, which was of logs and very big, each chief, as was the custom, laid down his spear or rifle and his knife. For as thou knowest, O Hair-Face, strong drink quickens, and old hates flame up, and head and hand are swift to act. But I noted that Ligoun had brought two knives, the one he left outside the door, the other slipped under his blanket, snug to the grip. The other chiefs did likewise, and I was troubled for what was to come.", "\"The chiefs were ranged, sitting, in a big circle about the room. I stood at Ligoun's elbow. In the middle was the barrel of quass, and by it a slave to serve the drink. First, Niblack made oration, with much show of friendship and many fine words. Then he gave a sign, and the slave dipped a gourd full of quass and passed it to Ligoun, as was fit, for his was the highest rank.", "\"Ligoun drank it, to the last drop, and I gave him my strength to get on his feet so that he, too, might make oration. He had kind speech for the many tribes, noted the greatness of Niblack to give such a feast, counselled for peace as was his custom, and at the end said that the quass was very good.", "\"Then Niblack drank, being next of rank to Ligoun, and after him one chief and another in degree and order. And each spoke friendly words and said that the quass was good, till all had drunk. Did I say all? Nay, not all, O Hair-Face. For last of them was one, a lean and catlike man, young of face, with a quick and daring eye, who drank darkly, and spat forth upon the ground, and spoke no word.", "\"To not say that the quass was good were insult; to spit forth upon the ground were worse than insult. And this very thing did he do. He was known for a chief over the Sticks of the Yukon, and further naught was known of him.", "\"As I say, it was an insult. But mark this, O Hair-Face: it was an insult, not to Niblack the feast-giver, but to the man chiefest of rank who sat among those of the circle. And that man was Ligoun. There was no sound. All eyes were upon him to see what he might do. He made no movement. His withered lips trembled not into speech; nor did a nostril quiver, nor an eyelid droop. But I saw that he looked wan and gray, as I have seen old men look of bitter mornings when famine pressed, and the women wailed and the children whimpered, and there was no meat nor sign of meat. And as the old men looked, so looked Ligoun.", "\"There was no sound. It were as a circle of the dead, but that each chief felt beneath his blanket to make sure, and that each chief glanced to his neighbor, right and left, with a measuring eye. I was a stripling; the things I had seen were few; yet I knew it to be the moment one meets but once in all a lifetime.", "\"And still Ligoun said naught, though he made the sign to me and with my strength arose and stood upright on his two feet. He was as an old pine, naked and gray, but still a-shoulder to the frost and storm. His eyes were unblinking, and as he had not heard Opitsah, so it seemed he did not see him.", "\"And Opitsah was mad with anger, and danced stiff-legged before him, as men do when they wish to give another shame. And Opitsah sang a song of his own greatness and the greatness of his people, filled with bad words for the Chilcats and for Ligoun. And as he danced and sang, Opitsah threw off his blanket and with his knife drew bright circles before the face of Ligoun. And the song he sang was the Song of the Knife.", "\"And there was no other sound, only the singing of Opitsah, and the circle of chiefs that were as dead, save that the flash of the knife seemed to draw smouldering fire from their eyes. And Ligoun, also, was very still. Yet did he know his death, and was unafraid. And the knife sang closer and yet closer to his face, but his eyes were unblinking and he swayed not to right or left, or this way or that.", "\"And Opitsah drove in the knife, so, twice on the forehead of Ligoun, and the red blood leaped after it. And then it was that Ligoun gave me the sign to bear up under him with my youth that he might walk. And he laughed with a great scorn, full in the face of Opitsah, the Knife. And he brushed Opitsah to the side, as one brushes to the side a low-hanging branch on the trail and passes on.", "\"And I knew and understood, for there was but shame in the killing of Opitsah before the faces of a score of greater chiefs. I remembered the Law, and knew Ligoun had it in mind to kill by the Law. And who, chiefest of rank but himself, was there but Niblack? And toward Niblack, leaning on my arm, he walked. And to his other arm, clinging and striking, was Opitsah, too small to soil with his blood the hands of so great a man. And though the knife of Opitsah bit in again and again, Ligoun noted it not, nor winced. And in this fashion we three went our way across the room, Niblack sitting in his blanket and fearful of our coming.", "\"And now old hates flamed up and forgotten grudges were remembered. Lamuk, a Kake, had had a brother drowned in the bad water of the Stickeen, and the Stickeens had not paid in blankets for their bad water, as was the custom to pay. So Lamuk drove straight with his long knife to the heart of Klok-Kutz the Stickeen. And Katchahook remembered a quarrel of the Naass River people with the Tongas of north of Dixon, and the chief of the Tongas he slew with a pistol which made much noise. And the blood-hunger gripped all the men who sat in the circle, and chief slew chief, or was slain, as chance might be. Also did they stab and shoot at Ligoun, for whoso killed him won great honor and would be unforgotten for the deed. And they were about him like wolves about a moose, only they were so many they were in their own way, and they slew one another to make room. And there was great confusion.", "\"But Ligoun went slowly, without haste, as though many years were yet before him. It seemed that he was certain he would make his kill, in his own way, ere they could slay him. And as I say, he went slowly, and knives bit into him, and he was red with blood. And though none sought after me, who was a mere stripling, yet did the knives find me, and the hot bullets burn me. And still Ligoun leaned his weight on my youth, and Opitsah struck at him, and we three went forward. And when we stood by Niblack, he was afraid, and covered his head with his blanket. The Skoots were ever cowards.", "\"And Goolzug and Kadishan, the one a fish-eater and the other a meat-killer, closed together for the honor of their tribes. And they raged madly about, and in their battling swung against the knees of Opitsah, who was overthrown and trampled upon. And a knife, singing through the air, smote Skulpin, of the Sitkas, in the throat, and he flung his arms out blindly, reeling, and dragged me down in his fall.", "\"And from the ground I beheld Ligoun bend over Niblack, and uncover the blanket from his head, and turn up his face to the light. And Ligoun was in no haste. Being blinded with his own blood, he swept it out of his eyes with the back of his hand, so he might see and be sure. And when he was sure that the upturned face was the face of Niblack, he drew the knife across his throat as one draws a knife across the throat of a trembling deer. And then Ligoun stood erect, singing his death-song and swaying gently to and fro. And Skulpin, who had dragged me down, shot with a pistol from where he lay, and Ligoun toppled and fell, as an old pine topples and falls in the teeth of the wind.\"", "\"I? I did remember the Law, and I slew Opitsah the Knife, which was well. And I drew Ligoun's own knife from the throat of Niblack, and slew Skulpin, who had dragged me down. For I was a stripling, and I could slay any man and it were honor. And further, Ligoun being dead, there was no need for my youth, and I laid about me with his knife, choosing the chiefest of rank that yet remained.\"", "Palitlum fumbled under his shirt and drew forth a beaded sheath, and from the sheath, a knife. It was a knife home-wrought and crudely fashioned from a whip-saw file; a knife such as one may find possessed by old men in a hundred Alaskan villages.", "But Palitlum looked at me slowly. \"Hair-Face, I am weak as water, and easy as a woman. I have soiled my belly with quass, and hooch, and 'Three Star.' My eyes are blunted, my ears have lost their keenness, and my strength has gone into fat. And I am without honor in these days, and am called Palitlum, the Drinker. Yet honor was mine at the potlatch of Niblack, on the Skoot, and the memory of it, and the memory of Ligoun, be dear to me. Nay, didst thou turn the sea itself into 'Three Star' and say that it were all mine for the knife, yet would I keep the knife. I am Palitlum, the Drinker, but I was once Olo, the Ever-Hungry, who bore up Ligoun with his youth!\"", "And as I looked on the frown of the cliff at our backs, I saw the shadow of a man's torso, monstrous beneath a huge inverted bottle.", "So called Li Wan to the man whose head was hidden beneath the squirrel-skin robe, but she called softly, as though divided between the duty of waking him and the fear of him awake. For she was afraid of this big husband of hers, who was like unto none of the men she had known. The moose-meat sizzled uneasily, and she moved the frying-pan to one side of the red embers. As she did so she glanced warily at the two Hudson Bay dogs dripping eager slaver from their scarlet tongues and following her every movement. They were huge, hairy fellows, crouched to leeward in the thin smoke-wake of the fire to escape the swarming myriads of mosquitoes. As Li Wan gazed down the steep to where the Klondike flung its swollen flood between the hills, one of the dogs bellied its way forward like a worm, and with a deft, catlike stroke of the paw dipped a chunk of hot meat out of the pan to the ground. But Li Wan caught him from out the tail of her eye, and he sprang back with a snap and a snarl as she rapped him over the nose with a stick of firewood.", "\"Nay, Olo,\" she laughed, recovering the meat without removing her eye from him. \"Thou art ever hungry, and for that thy nose leads thee into endless troubles.\"", "But the mate of Olo joined him, and together they defied the woman. The hair on their backs and shoulders bristled in recurrent waves of anger, and the thin lips writhed and lifted into ugly wrinkles, exposing the flesh-tearing fangs, cruel and menacing. Their very noses serrulated and shook in brute passion, and they snarled as the wolves snarl, with all the hatred and malignity of the breed impelling them to spring upon the woman and drag her down.", "\"And thou, too, Bash, fierce as thy master and never at peace with the hand that feeds thee! This is not thy quarrel, so that be thine! and that!\"", "As she cried, she drove at them with the firewood, but they avoided the blows and refused to retreat. They separated and approached her from either side, crouching low and snarling. Li Wan had struggled with the wolf-dog for mastery from the time she toddled among the skin-bales of the teepee, and she knew a crisis was at hand. Bash had halted, his muscles stiff and tense for the spring; Olo was yet creeping into striking distance.", "Grasping two blazing sticks by the charred ends, she faced the brutes. The one held back, but Bash sprang, and she met him in mid-air with the flaming weapon. There were sharp yelps of pain and swift odors of burning hair and flesh as he rolled in the dirt and the woman ground the fiery embers into his mouth. Snapping wildly, he flung himself sidewise out of her reach and in a frenzy of fear scrambled for safety. Olo, on the other side, had begun his retreat, when Li Wan reminded him of her primacy by hurling a heavy stick of wood into his ribs. Then the pair retreated under a rain of firewood, and on the edge of the camp fell to licking their wounds and whimpering by turns and snarling.", "Li Wan blew the ashes off the meat and sat down again. Her heart had not gone up a beat, and the incident was already old, for this was the routine of life. Canim had not stirred during the disorder, but instead had set up a lusty snoring.", "The squirrel-skin robe was agitated and cast aside by a brown arm. Then the man's eyelids fluttered and drooped again.", "A mosquito stung her on the neck, and she daubed the unprotected spot with wet clay from a ball she had convenient to hand. All morning, toiling up the divide and enveloped in a cloud of the pests, the man and woman had plastered themselves with the sticky mud, which, drying in the sun, covered their faces with masks of clay. These masks, broken in divers places by the movement of the facial muscles, had constantly to be renewed, so that the deposit was irregular of depth and peculiar of aspect.", "Li Wan shook Canim gently but with persistence till he roused and sat up. His first glance was to the sun, and after consulting the celestial timepiece he hunched over to the fire and fell-to ravenously on the meat. He was a large Indian fully six feet in height, deep-chested and heavy-muscled, and his eyes were keener and vested with greater mental vigor than the average of his kind. The lines of will had marked his face deeply, and this, coupled with a sternness and primitiveness, advertised a native indomitability, unswerving of purpose, and prone, when thwarted, to sullen cruelty.", "\"To-morrow, Li Wan, we shall feast.\" He sucked a marrow-bone clean and threw it to the dogs. \"We shall have _flapjacks_ fried in _bacon grease_, and _sugar_, which is more toothsome--\"", "\"Ay,\" Canim answered with superiority; \"and I shall teach you new ways of cookery. Of these things I speak you are ignorant, and of many more things besides. You have lived your days in a little corner of the earth and know nothing. But I,\"--he straightened himself and looked at her pridefully,--\"I am a great traveller, and have been all places, even among the white people, and I am versed in their ways, and in the ways of many peoples. I am not a tree, born to stand in one place always and know not what there be over the next hill; for I am Canim, the Canoe, made to go here and there and to journey and quest up and down the length and breadth of the world.\"", "She bowed her head humbly. \"It is true. I have eaten fish and meat and berries all my days and lived in a little corner of the earth. Nor did I dream the world was so large until you stole me from my people and I cooked and carried for you on the endless trails.\" She looked up at him suddenly. \"Tell me, Canim, does this trail ever end?\"", "\"Nay,\" he answered. \"My trail is like the world; it never ends. My trail _is_ the world, and I have travelled it since the time my legs could carry me, and I shall travel it until I die. My father and my mother may be dead, but it is long since I looked upon them, and I do not care. My tribe is like your tribe. It stays in the one place--which is far from here,--but I care naught for my tribe, for I am Canim, the Canoe!\"", "\"You, Li Wan, are my wife, and the wife travels the husband's trail wheresoever it goes. It is the law. And were it not the law, yet would it be the law of Canim, who is lawgiver unto himself and his.\"", "\"Be not in haste,\" Canim cautioned her, as she began to strap the meagre camp outfit to her pack. \"The sun is yet hot, and the trail leads down and the footing is good.\"", "\"Like other women, your hair is black; but have you ever noticed that it is soft and fine, softer and finer than the hair of other women?\"", "\"It is a year, now, since I took you from your people,\" he went on, \"and you are nigh as shy and afraid of me as when first I looked upon you. How does this thing be?\"", "Li Wan shook her head. \"I am afraid of you, Canim, you are so big and strange. And further, before you looked upon me even, I was afraid of all the young men. I do not know ... I cannot say ... only it seemed, somehow, as though I should not be for them, as though ...\"", "\"I do not know, I ...\" She shook her head in a bewildered manner. \"I cannot put into words the way I felt. It was strangeness in me. I was unlike other maidens, who sought the young men slyly. I could not care for the young men that way. It would have been a great wrong, it seemed, and an ill deed.\"", "She stammered, and her eyes were piteous and pleading, but his will dominated her and wrung from her lips the reluctant speech.", "\"But it was only dreams, Canim, ill dreams of childhood, shadows of things not real, visions such as the dogs, sleeping in the sun-warmth, behold and whine out against.\"", "\"They are forgotten memories,\" she protested. \"As a child I dreamed awake, with my eyes open to the day, and when I spoke of the strange things I saw I was laughed at, and the other children were afraid and drew away from me. And when I spoke of the things I saw to Pow-Wah-Kaan, she chided me and said they were evil; also she beat me. It was a sickness, I believe, like the falling-sickness that comes to old men; and in time I grew better and dreamed no more. And now ... I cannot remember\"--she brought her hand in a confused manner to her forehead--\"they are there, somewhere, but I cannot find them, only ...\"", "\"Nay, Li Wan. Dreams are dreams. They may be memories of other lives we have lived. I was once a moose. I firmly believe I was once a moose, what of the things I have seen in dreams, and heard.\"", "Strive as he would to hide it, a growing anxiety was manifest, but Li Wan, groping after the words with which to paint the picture, took no heed.", "\"I see a snow-tramped space among the trees,\" she began, \"and across the snow the sign of a man where he has dragged himself heavily on hand and knee. And I see, too, the man in the snow, and it seems I am very close to him when I look. He is unlike real men, for he has hair on his face, much hair, and the hair of his face and head is yellow like the summer coat of the weasel. His eyes are closed, but they open and search about. They are blue like the sky, and look into mine and search no more. And his hand moves, slow, as from weakness, and I feel ...\"", "\"No! no!\" she cried in haste. \"I feel nothing. Did I say 'feel'? I did not mean it. It could not be that I should mean it. I see, and I see only, and that is all I see--a man in the snow, with eyes like the sky, and hair like the weasel. I have seen it many times, and always it is the same--a man in the snow--\"", "\"And do you see yourself?\" he asked, leaning forward and regarding her intently. \"Do you ever see yourself and the man in the snow?\"", "His muscles relaxed and he sank back, an exultant satisfaction in his eyes which he turned from her so that she might not see.", "\"I will tell you, Li Wan,\" he spoke decisively; \"you were a little bird in some life before, a little moose-bird, when you saw this thing, and the memory of it is with you yet. It is not strange. I was once a moose, and my father's father afterward became a bear--so said the shaman, and the shaman cannot lie. Thus, on the Trail of the Gods we pass from life to life, and the gods know only and understand. Dreams and the shadows of dreams be memories, nothing more, and the dog, whining asleep in the sun-warmth, doubtless sees and remembers things gone before. Bash, there, was a warrior once. I do firmly believe he was once a warrior.\"", "Canim tossed a bone to the brute and got upon his feet. \"Come, let us begone. The sun is yet hot, but it will get no cooler.\"", "\"Like you and me,\" he answered, \"only they are less dark of skin. You will be among them ere the day is dead.\"", "Canim lashed the sleeping-robe to his one-hundred-and-fifty-pound pack, smeared his face with wet clay, and sat down to rest till Li Wan had finished loading the dogs. Olo cringed at sight of the club in her hand, and gave no trouble when the bundle of forty pounds and odd was strapped upon him. But Bash was aggrieved and truculent, and could not forbear to whimper and snarl as he was forced to receive the burden. He bristled his back and bared his teeth as she drew the straps tight, the while throwing all the malignancy of his nature into the glances shot at her sideways and backward. And Canim chuckled and said, \"Did I not say he was once a very great warrior?\"", "\"These furs will bring a price,\" he remarked as he adjusted his head-strap and lifted his pack clear of the ground. \"A big price. The white men pay well for such goods, for they have no time to hunt and are soft to the cold. Soon shall we feast, Li Wan, as you have feasted never in all the lives you have lived before.\"", "\"The next time I am born, I would be born a white man,\" he added, and swung off down the trail which dived into the gorge at his feet.", "The dogs followed close at his heels, and Li Wan brought up the rear. But her thoughts were far away, across the Ice Mountains to the east, to the little corner of the earth where her childhood had been lived. Ever as a child, she remembered, she had been looked upon as strange, as one with an affliction. Truly she had dreamed awake and been scolded and beaten for the remarkable visions she saw, till, after a time, she had outgrown them. But not utterly. Though they troubled her no more waking, they came to her in her sleep, grown woman that she was, and many a night of nightmare was hers, filled with fluttering shapes, vague and meaningless. The talk with Canim had excited her, and down all the twisted slant of the divide she harked back to the mocking fantasies of her dreams.", "He rested his pack on a jutting rock, slipped the head-strap, and sat down. Li Wan joined him, and the dogs sprawled panting on the ground beside them. At their feet rippled the glacial drip of the hills, but it was muddy and discolored, as if soiled by some commotion of the earth.", "\"Because of the white men who work in the ground. Listen!\" He held up his hand, and they heard the ring of pick and shovel, and the sound of men's voices. \"They are made mad by _gold_, and work without ceasing that they may find it. _Gold?_ It is yellow and comes from the ground, and is considered of great value. It is also a measure of price.\"", "But Li Wan's roving eyes had called her attention from him. A few yards below and partly screened by a clump of young spruce, the tiered logs of a cabin rose to meet its overhanging roof of dirt. A thrill ran through her, and all her dream-phantoms roused up and stirred about uneasily.", "She eyed it wistfully, grasping its virtues at a glance and thrilling again at the unaccountable sensations it aroused. \"It must be very warm in time of frost,\" she said aloud, though she felt that she must make strange sounds with her lips.", "She felt impelled to utter them, but did not, and the next instant Canim said, \"It is called a _cabin_.\"", "Her heart gave a great leap. The sounds! the very sounds! She looked about her in sudden awe. How should she know that strange word before ever she heard it? What could be the matter? And then with a shock, half of fear and half of delight, she realized that for the first time in her life there had been sanity and significance in the promptings of her dreams.", "\"_Cabin_\" she repeated to herself. \"_Cabin._\" An incoherent flood of dream-stuff welled up and up till her head was dizzy and her heart seemed bursting. Shadows, and looming bulks of things, and unintelligible associations fluttered and whirled about, and she strove vainly with her consciousness to grasp and hold them. For she felt that there, in that welter of memories, was the key of the mystery; could she but grasp and hold it, all would be clear and plain--", "She turned to Canim, speechless and trembling, the dream-stuff in mad, overwhelming riot. She was sick and fainting, and could only listen to the ravishing sounds which proceeded from the cabin in a wonderful rhythm.", "But she did not hear him, for in the ecstasy she was experiencing, it seemed at last that all things were coming clear. Now! now! she thought. A sudden moisture swept into her eyes, and the tears trickled down her cheeks. The mystery was unlocking, but the faintness was overpowering her. If only she could hold herself long enough! If only--but the landscape bent and crumpled up, and the hills swayed back and forth across the sky as she sprang upright and screamed, \"_Daddy! Daddy!_\" Then the sun reeled, and darkness smote her, and she pitched forward limp and headlong among the rocks.", "Canim looked to see if her neck had been broken by the heavy pack, grunted his satisfaction, and threw water upon her from the creek. She came to slowly, with choking sobs, and sat up.", "\"We shall camp early, so that you may sleep long and win strength,\" he said gently. \"And if we go now, we shall be the quicker to bed.\"", "Li Wan said nothing, but tottered to her feet in obedience and stirred up the dogs. She took the swing of his pace mechanically, and followed him past the cabin, scarce daring to breathe. But no sounds issued forth, though the door was open and smoke curling upward from the sheet-iron stovepipe.", "They came upon a man in the bend of the creek, white of skin and blue of eye, and for a moment Li Wan saw the other man in the snow. But she saw dimly, for she was weak and tired from what she had undergone. Still, she looked at him curiously, and stopped with Canim to watch him at his work. He was washing gravel in a large pan, with a circular, tilting movement; and as they looked, giving a deft flirt, he flashed up the yellow gold in a broad streak across the bottom of the pan.", "\"Very rich, this creek,\" Canim told her, as they went on. \"Sometime I will find such a creek, and then I shall be a big man.\"", "Cabins and men grew more plentiful, till they came to where the main portion of the creek was spread out before them. It was the scene of a vast devastation. Everywhere the earth was torn and rent as though by a Titan's struggles. Where there were no upthrown mounds of gravel, great holes and trenches yawned, and chasms where the thick rime of the earth had been peeled to bed-rock. There was no worn channel for the creek, and its waters, dammed up, diverted, flying through the air on giddy flumes, trickling into sinks and low places, and raised by huge water-wheels, were used and used again a thousand times. The hills had been stripped of their trees, and their raw sides gored and perforated by great timber-slides and prospect holes. And over all, like a monstrous race of ants, was flung an army of men--mud-covered, dirty, dishevelled men, who crawled in and out of the holes of their digging, crept like big bugs along the flumes, and toiled and sweated at the gravel-heaps which they kept in constant unrest--men, as far as the eye could see, even to the rims of the hilltops, digging, tearing, and scouring the face of nature.", "\"Small wonder. The gold they dig after is a great thing,\" he replied. \"It is the greatest thing in the world.\"", "For hours they threaded the chaos of greed, Canim eagerly intent, Li Wan weak and listless. She knew she had been on the verge of disclosure, and she felt that she was still on the verge of disclosure, but the nervous strain she had undergone had tired her, and she passively waited for the thing, she knew not what, to happen. From every hand her senses snatched up and conveyed to her innumerable impressions, each of which became a dull excitation to her jaded imagination. Somewhere within her, responsive notes were answering to the things without, forgotten and undreamed-of correspondences were being renewed; and she was aware of it in an incurious way, and her soul was troubled, but she was not equal to the mental exultation necessary to transmute and understand. So she plodded wearily on at the heels of her lord, content to wait for that which she knew, somewhere, somehow, must happen.", "After undergoing the mad bondage of man, the creek finally returned to its ancient ways, all soiled and smirched from its toil, and coiled lazily among the broad flats and timbered spaces where the valley widened to its mouth. Here the \"pay\" ran out, and men were loth to loiter with the lure yet beyond. And here, as Li Wan paused to prod Olo with her staff, she heard the mellow silver of a woman's laughter.", "Before a cabin sat a woman, fair of skin and rosy as a child, dimpling with glee at the words of another woman in the doorway. But the woman who sat shook about her great masses of dark, wet hair which yielded up its dampness to the warm caresses of the sun.", "For an instant Li Wan stood transfixed. Then she was aware of a blinding flash, and a snap, as though something gave way; and the woman before the cabin vanished, and the cabin and the tall spruce timber, and the jagged sky-line, and Li Wan saw another woman, in the shine of another sun, brushing great masses of black hair, and singing as she brushed. And Li Wan heard the words of the song, and understood, and was a child again. She was smitten with a vision, wherein all the troublesome dreams merged and became one, and shapes and shadows took up their accustomed round, and all was clear and plain and real. Many pictures jostled past, strange scenes, and trees, and flowers, and people; and she saw them and knew them all.", "\"When I was a little moose-bird,\" she whispered, so faint and low he scarcely heard. And she knew she lied, as she bent her head to the strap and took the swing of the trail.", "And such was the strangeness of it, the real now became unreal. The mile tramp and the pitching of camp by the edge of the stream seemed like a passage in a nightmare. She cooked the meat, fed the dogs, and unlashed the packs as in a dream, and it was not until Canim began to sketch his next wandering that she became herself again.", "\"The Klondike runs into the Yukon,\" he was saying; \"a mighty river, mightier than the Mackenzie, of which you know. So we go, you and I, down to Fort o' Yukon. With dogs, in time of winter, it is twenty sleeps. Then we follow the Yukon away into the west--one hundred sleeps, two hundred--I have never heard. It is very far. And then we come to the sea. You know nothing of the sea, so let me tell you. As the lake is to the island, so the sea is to the land; all the rivers run to it, and it is without end. I have seen it at Hudson Bay; I have yet to see it in Alaska. And then we may take a great canoe upon the sea, you and I, Li Wan, or we may follow the land into the south many a hundred sleeps. And after that I do not know, save that I am Canim, the Canoe, wanderer and far-journeyer over the earth!\"", "She sat and listened, and fear ate into her heart as she pondered over this plunge into the illimitable wilderness. \"It is a weary way,\" was all she said, head bowed on knee in resignation.", "Then it was a splendid thought came to her, and at the wonder of it she was all aglow. She went down to the stream and washed the dried clay from her face. When the ripples died away, she stared long at her mirrored features; but sun and weather-beat had done their work, and, what of roughness and bronze, her skin was not soft and dimpled as a child's. But the thought was still splendid and the glow unabated as she crept in beside her husband under the sleeping-robe.", "She lay awake, staring up at the blue of the sky and waiting for Canim to sink into the first deep sleep. When this came about, she wormed slowly and carefully away, tucked the robe around him, and stood up. At her second step, Bash growled savagely. She whispered persuasively to him and glanced at the man. Canim was snoring profoundly. Then she turned, and with swift, noiseless feet sped up the back trail.", "Mrs. Evelyn Van Wyck was just preparing for bed. Bored by the duties put upon her by society, her wealth, and widowed blessedness, she had journeyed into the Northland and gone to housekeeping in a cosey cabin on the edge of the diggings. Here, aided and abetted by her friend and companion, Myrtle Giddings, she played at living close to the soil, and cultivated the primitive with refined abandon.", "She strove to get away from the generations of culture and parlor selection, and sought the earth-grip her ancestors had forfeited. Likewise she induced mental states which she fondly believed to approximate those of the stone-folk, and just now, as she put up her hair for the pillow, she was indulging her fancy with a palaeolithic wooing. The details consisted principally of cave-dwellings and cracked marrow-bones, intersprinkled with fierce carnivora, hairy mammoths, and combats with rude flaked knives of flint; but the sensations were delicious. And as Evelyn Van Wyck fled through the sombre forest aisles before the too arduous advances of her slant-browed, skin-clad wooer, the door of the cabin opened, without the courtesy of a knock, and a skin-clad woman, savage and primitive, came in.", "With a leap that would have done credit to a cave-woman, Miss Giddings landed in safety behind the table. But Mrs. Van Wyck held her ground. She noticed that the intruder was laboring under a strong excitement, and cast a swift glance backward to assure herself that the way was clear to the bunk, where the big Colt's revolver lay beneath a pillow.", "But she said it in her own tongue, the tongue spoken in but a little corner of the earth, and the women did not understand.", "\"The poor creature is harmless, I think,\" Mrs. Van Wyck replied. \"And just look at her skin-clothes, ragged and trail-worn and all that. They are certainly unique. I shall buy them for my collection. Get my sack, Myrtle, please, and set up the scales.\"", "Li Wan followed the shaping of the lips, but the words were unintelligible, and then, and for the first time, she realized, in a moment of suspense and indecision, that there was no medium of communication between them.", "And at the passion of her dumbness she cried out, with arms stretched wide apart, \"O Woman, thou art sister of mine!\"", "The tears coursed down her cheeks as she yearned toward them, and the break in her voice carried the sorrow she could not utter. But Miss Giddings was trembling, and even Mrs. Van Wyck was disturbed.", "\"I would live as you live. Thy ways are my ways, and our ways be one. My husband is Canim, the Canoe, and he is big and strange, and I am afraid. His trail is all the world and never ends, and I am weary. My mother was like you, and her hair was as thine, and her eyes. And life was soft to me then, and the sun warm.\"", "She knelt humbly, and bent her head at Mrs. Van Wyck's feet. But Mrs. Van Wyck drew away, frightened at her vehemence.", "She touched Li Wan's ragged skins to indicate her choice, and poured several hundreds of gold into the blower. She stirred the dust about and trickled its yellow lustre temptingly through her fingers. But Li Wan saw only the fingers, milk-white and shapely, tapering daintily to the rosy, jewel-like nails. She placed her own hand alongside, all work-worn and calloused, and wept.", "Mrs. Van Wyck misunderstood. \"Gold,\" she encouraged. \"Good gold! You trade? You changee for changee?\" And she laid her hand again on Li Wan's skin garments.", "\"How much? You sell? How much?\" she persisted, running her hand against the way of the hair so that she might make sure of the sinew-thread seam.", "But Li Wan was deaf as well, and the woman's speech was without significance. Dismay at her failure sat upon her. How could she identify herself with these women? For she knew they were of the one breed, blood-sisters among men and the women of men. Her eyes roved wildly about the interior, taking in the soft draperies hanging around, the feminine garments, the oval mirror, and the dainty toilet accessories beneath. And the things haunted her, for she had seen like things before; and as she looked at them her lips involuntarily formed sounds which her throat trembled to utter. Then a thought flashed upon her, and she steadied herself. She must be calm. She must control herself, for there must be no misunderstanding this time, or else,--and she shook with a storm of suppressed tears and steadied herself again.", "She looked at Mrs. Van Wyck, who nodded approbation. Li Wan exulted, but brought her will to bear and held herself steady. \"_Stove_\" she went on. \"_Stove_.\"", "And at every nod of Mrs. Van Wyck, Li Wan's excitement mounted. Now stumbling and halting, and again in feverish haste, as the recrudescence of forgotten words was fast or slow, she moved about the cabin, naming article after article. And when she paused finally, it was in triumph, with body erect and head thrown back, expectant, waiting.", "Li Wan nodded her head seriously. They were beginning to understand her at last, these women. The blood flushed darkly under her bronze at the thought, and she smiled and nodded her head still more vigorously.", "Mrs. Van Wyck turned to her companion. \"Received a smattering of mission education somewhere, I fancy, and has come to show it off.\"", "\"All the same I want that jacket. If it _is_ old, the workmanship is good--a most excellent specimen.\" She returned to her visitor. \"Changee for changee? You! Changee for changee? How much? Eh? How much, you?\"", "Mrs. Van Wyck went up to Li Wan and made signs that she would exchange her wrapper for the jacket. And to further the transaction, she took Li Wan's hand and placed it amid the lace and ribbons of the flowing bosom, and rubbed the fingers back and forth so they might feel the texture. But the jewelled butterfly which loosely held the fold in place was insecurely fastened, and the front of the gown slipped to the side, exposing a firm white breast, which had never known the lip-clasp of a child.", "Mrs. Van Wyck coolly repaired the mischief; but Li Wan uttered a loud cry, and ripped and tore at her skin-shirt till her own breast showed firm and white as Evelyn Van Wyck's. Murmuring inarticulately and making swift signs, she strove to establish the kinship.", "Miss Giddings made a fastidious gesture. \"Proud of her father's white skin. It's beastly! Do give her something, Evelyn, and make her go.\"", "A heavy foot crunched the gravel without. Then the cabin door swung wide, and Canim stalked in. Miss Giddings saw a vision of sudden death, and screamed; but Mrs. Van Wyck faced him composedly.", "\"Daughter of Pow-Wah-Kaan? Nay, of what is it to them that they should care? Better should I tell them thou art an ill wife, given to creeping from thy husband's bed when sleep is heavy in his eyes.\"", "Again he reached out for her, but she fled away from him to Mrs. Van Wyck, at whose feet she made frenzied appeal, and whose knees she tried to clasp. But the lady stepped back and gave permission with her eyes to Canim. He gripped Li Wan under the shoulders and raised her to her feet. She fought with him, in a madness of despair, till his chest was heaving with the exertion, and they had reeled about over half the room.", "But he twisted her wrist till she ceased to struggle. \"The memories of the little moose-bird are overstrong and make trouble,\" he began.", "\"I know! I know!\" she broke in. \"I see the man in the snow, and as never before I see him crawl on hand and knee. And I, who am a little child, am carried on his back. And this is before Pow-Wah-Kaan and the time I came to live in a little corner of the earth.\"", "\"You know,\" he answered, forcing her toward the door; \"but you will go with me down the Yukon and forget.\"", "\"Never shall I forget! So long as my skin is white shall I remember!\" She clutched frantically at the door-post and looked a last appeal to Mrs. Evelyn Van Wyck.", "At the Barracks a man was being tried for his life. He was an old man, a native from the Whitefish River, which empties into the Yukon below Lake Le Barge. All Dawson was wrought up over the affair, and likewise the Yukon-dwellers for a thousand miles up and down. It has been the custom of the land-robbing and sea-robbing Anglo-Saxon to give the law to conquered peoples, and ofttimes this law is harsh. But in the case of Imber the law for once seemed inadequate and weak. In the mathematical nature of things, equity did not reside in the punishment to be accorded him. The punishment was a foregone conclusion, there could be no doubt of that; and though it was capital, Imber had but one life, while the tale against him was one of scores.", "In fact, the blood of so many was upon his hands that the killings attributed to him did not permit of precise enumeration. Smoking a pipe by the trail-side or lounging around the stove, men made rough estimates of the numbers that had perished at his hand. They had been whites, all of them, these poor murdered people, and they had been slain singly, in pairs, and in parties. And so purposeless and wanton had been these killings, that they had long been a mystery to the mounted police, even in the time of the captains, and later, when the creeks realized, and a governor came from the Dominion to make the land pay for its prosperity.", "But more mysterious still was the coming of Imber to Dawson to give himself up. It was in the late spring, when the Yukon was growling and writhing under its ice, that the old Indian climbed painfully up the bank from the river trail and stood blinking on the main street. Men who had witnessed his advent, noted that he was weak and tottery, and that he staggered over to a heap of cabin-logs and sat down. He sat there a full day, staring straight before him at the unceasing tide of white men that flooded past. Many a head jerked curiously to the side to meet his stare, and more than one remark was dropped anent the old Siwash with so strange a look upon his face. No end of men remembered afterward that they had been struck by his extraordinary figure, and forever afterward prided themselves upon their swift discernment of the unusual.", "But it remained for Dickensen, Little Dickensen, to be the hero of the occasion. Little Dickensen had come into the land with great dreams and a pocketful of cash; but with the cash the dreams vanished, and to earn his passage back to the States he had accepted a clerical position with the brokerage firm of Holbrook and Mason. Across the street from the office of Holbrook and Mason was the heap of cabin-logs upon which Imber sat. Dickensen looked out of the window at him before he went to lunch; and when he came back from lunch he looked out of the window, and the old Siwash was still there.", "Dickensen continued to look out of the window, and he, too, forever afterward prided himself upon his swiftness of discernment. He was a romantic little chap, and he likened the immobile old heathen to the genius of the Siwash race, gazing calm-eyed upon the hosts of the invading Saxon. The hours swept along, but Imber did not vary his posture, did not by a hair's-breadth move a muscle; and Dickensen remembered the man who once sat upright on a sled in the main street where men passed to and fro. They thought the man was resting, but later, when they touched him, they found him stiff and cold, frozen to death in the midst of the busy street. To undouble him, that he might fit into a coffin, they had been forced to lug him to a fire and thaw him out a bit. Dickensen shivered at the recollection.", "Later on, Dickensen went out on the sidewalk to smoke a cigar and cool off; and a little later Emily Travis happened along. Emily Travis was dainty and delicate and rare, and whether in London or Klondike she gowned herself as befitted the daughter of a millionnaire mining engineer. Little Dickensen deposited his cigar on an outside window ledge where he could find it again, and lifted his hat.", "They chatted for ten minutes or so, when Emily Travis, glancing past Dickensen's shoulder, gave a startled little scream. Dickensen turned about to see, and was startled, too. Imber had crossed the street and was standing there, a gaunt and hungry-looking shadow, his gaze riveted upon the girl.", "Imber grunted and stalked up to Emily Travis. He looked her over, keenly and carefully, every square inch of her. Especially did he appear interested in her silky brown hair, and in the color of her cheek, faintly sprayed and soft, like the downy bloom of a butterfly wing. He walked around her, surveying her with the calculating eye of a man who studies the lines upon which a horse or a boat is builded. In the course of his circuit the pink shell of her ear came between his eye and the westering sun, and he stopped to contemplate its rosy transparency. Then he returned to her face and looked long and intently into her blue eyes. He grunted and laid a hand on her arm midway between the shoulder and elbow. With his other hand he lifted her forearm and doubled it back. Disgust and wonder showed in his face, and he dropped her arm with a contemptuous grunt. Then he muttered a few guttural syllables, turned his back upon her, and addressed himself to Dickensen.", "Dickensen could not understand his speech, and Emily Travis laughed. Imber turned from one to the other, frowning, but both shook their heads. He was about to go away, when she called out:", "Jimmy came from the other side of the street. He was a big, hulking Indian clad in approved white-man style, with an Eldorado king's sombrero on his head. He talked with Imber, haltingly, with throaty spasms. Jimmy was a Sitkan, possessed of no more than a passing knowledge of the interior dialects.", "\"Him Whitefish man,\" he said to Emily Travis. \"Me savve um talk no very much. Him want to look see chief white man.\"", "\"I t'ink um want Cap'n Alexander,\" he explained. \"Him say um kill white man, white woman, white boy, plenty kill um white people. Him want to die.\"", "A mounted policeman (unmounted for Klondike service) joined the group and heard Imber's wish repeated. He was a stalwart young fellow, broad-shouldered, deep-chested, legs cleanly built and stretched wide apart, and tall though Imber was, he towered above him by half a head. His eyes were cool, and gray, and steady, and he carried himself with the peculiar confidence of power that is bred of blood and tradition. His splendid masculinity was emphasized by his excessive boyishness,--he was a mere lad,--and his smooth cheek promised a blush as willingly as the cheek of a maid.", "Imber was drawn to him at once. The fire leaped into his eyes at sight of a sabre slash that scarred his cheek. He ran a withered hand down the young fellow's leg and caressed the swelling thew. He smote the broad chest with his knuckles, and pressed and prodded the thick muscle-pads that covered the shoulders like a cuirass. The group had been added to by curious passers-by--husky miners, mountaineers, and frontiersmen, sons of the long-legged and broad-shouldered generations. Imber glanced from one to another, then he spoke aloud in the Whitefish tongue.", "The policeman was sorry for him and stepped into the breach. \"I fancy there may be something in his story. I'll take him up to the captain for examination. Tell him to come along with me, Jimmy.\"", "\"Him say you no _skookum_, no strong, all the same very soft like little baby. Him break you, in um two hands, to little pieces. Him t'ink much funny, very strange, how you can be mother of men so big, so strong, like dat p'liceman.\"", "Emily Travers kept her eyes up and unfaltering, but her cheeks were sprayed with scarlet. Little Dickensen blushed and was quite embarrassed. The policeman's face blazed with his boy's blood.", "Thus it was that Imber found his way to the Barracks, where he made full and voluntary confession, and from the precincts of which he never emerged.", "Imber looked very tired. The fatigue of hopelessness and age was in his face. His shoulders drooped depressingly, and his eyes were lack-lustre. His mop of hair should have been white, but sun and weatherbeat had burned and bitten it so that it hung limp and lifeless and colorless. He took no interest in what went on around him. The courtroom was jammed with the men of the creeks and trails, and there was an ominous note in the rumble and grumble of their low-pitched voices, which came to his ears like the growl of the sea from deep caverns.", "He sat close by a window, and his apathetic eyes rested now and again on the dreary scene without. The sky was overcast, and a gray drizzle was falling. It was flood-time on the Yukon. The ice was gone, and the river was up in the town. Back and forth on the main street, in canoes and poling-boats, passed the people that never rested. Often he saw these boats turn aside from the street and enter the flooded square that marked the Barracks' parade-ground. Sometimes they disappeared beneath him, and he heard them jar against the house-logs and their occupants scramble in through the window. After that came the slush of water against men's legs as they waded across the lower room and mounted the stairs. Then they appeared in the doorway, with doffed hats and dripping sea-boots, and added themselves to the waiting crowd.", "And while they centred their looks on him, and in grim anticipation enjoyed the penalty he was to pay, Imber looked at them, and mused on their ways, and on their Law that never slept, but went on unceasing, in good times and bad, in flood and famine, through trouble and terror and death, and which would go on unceasing, it seemed to him, to the end of time.", "A man rapped sharply on a table, and the conversation droned away into silence. Imber looked at the man. He seemed one in authority, yet Imber divined the square-browed man who sat by a desk farther back to be the one chief over them all and over the man who had rapped. Another man by the same table uprose and began to read aloud from many fine sheets of paper. At the top of each sheet he cleared his throat, at the bottom moistened his fingers. Imber did not understand his speech, but the others did, and he knew that it made them angry. Sometimes it made them very angry, and once a man cursed him, in single syllables, stinging and tense, till a man at the table rapped him to silence.", "For an interminable period the man read. His monotonous, sing-song utterance lured Imber to dreaming, and he was dreaming deeply when the man ceased. A voice spoke to him in his own Whitefish tongue, and he roused up, without surprise, to look upon the face of his sister's son, a young man who had wandered away years agone to make his dwelling with the whites.", "\"I shall speak to thee what the man has spoken, which is the tale of the troubles thou hast done and which thou hast told, O fool, to the Captain Alexander. And thou shalt understand and say if it be true talk or talk not true. It is so commanded.\"", "Howkan had fallen among the mission folk and been taught by them to read and write. In his hands he held the many fine sheets from which the man had read aloud, and which had been taken down by a clerk when Imber first made confession, through the mouth of Jimmy, to Captain Alexander. Howkan began to read. Imber listened for a space, when a wonderment rose up in his face and he broke in abruptly.", "Howkan smirked with self-appreciation. His hair was parted in the middle. \"Nay, from the paper it comes, O Imber. Never have my ears heard. From the paper it comes, through my eyes, into my head, and out of my mouth to thee. Thus it comes.\"", "\"Thus it comes? It be there in the paper?\" Imber's voice sank in whisperful awe as he crackled the sheets 'twixt thumb and finger and stared at the charactery scrawled thereon. \"It be a great medicine, Howkan, and thou art a worker of wonders.\"", "\"It be nothing, it be nothing,\" the young man responded carelessly and pridefully. He read at hazard from the document: \"_In that year, before the break of the ice, came an old man, and a boy who was lame of one foot. These also did I kill, and the old man made much noise--_\"", "\"It be true,\" Imber interrupted breathlessly. \"He made much noise and would not die for a long time. But how dost thou know, Howkan? The chief man of the white men told thee, mayhap? No one beheld me, and him alone have I told.\"", "Imber stared hard at the ink-scrawled surface. \"As the hunter looks upon the snow and says, Here but yesterday there passed a rabbit; and here by the willow scrub it stood and listened, and heard, and was afraid; and here it turned upon its trail; and here it went with great swiftness, leaping wide; and here, with greater swiftness and wider leapings, came a lynx; and here, where the claws cut deep into the snow, the lynx made a very great leap; and here it struck, with the rabbit under and rolling belly up; and here leads off the trail of the lynx alone, and there is no more rabbit,--as the hunter looks upon the markings of the snow and says thus and so and here, dost thou, too, look upon the paper and say thus and so and here be the things old Imber hath done?\"", "\"Even so,\" said Howkan. \"And now do thou listen, and keep thy woman's tongue between thy teeth till thou art called upon for speech.\"", "Thereafter, and for a long time, Howkan read to him the confession, and Imber remained musing and silent At the end, he said:", "\"It be my talk, and true talk, but I am grown old, Howkan, and forgotten things come back to me which were well for the head man there to know. First, there was the man who came over the Ice Mountains, with cunning traps made of iron, who sought the beaver of the Whitefish. Him I slew. And there were three men seeking gold on the Whitefish long ago. Them also I slew, and left them to the wolverines. And at the Five Fingers there was a man with a raft and much meat.\"", "At the moments when Imber paused to remember, Howkan translated and a clerk reduced to writing. The courtroom listened stolidly to each unadorned little tragedy, till Imber told of a red-haired man whose eyes were crossed and whom he had killed with a remarkably long shot.", "\"Hell,\" said a man in the forefront of the onlookers. He said it soulfully and sorrowfully. He was red-haired. \"Hell,\" he repeated. \"That was my brother Bill.\" And at regular intervals throughout the session, his solemn \"Hell\" was heard in the courtroom; nor did his comrades check him, nor did the man at the table rap him to order.", "Imber's head drooped once more, and his eyes went dull, as though a film rose up and covered them from the world. And he dreamed as only age can dream upon the colossal futility of youth.", "Later, Howkan roused him again, saying: \"Stand up, O Imber. It be commanded that thou tellest why you did these troubles, and slew these people, and at the end journeyed here seeking the Law.\"", "Imber rose feebly to his feet and swayed back and forth. He began to speak in a low and faintly rumbling voice, but Howkan interrupted him.", "\"This old man, he is damn crazy,\" he said in English to the square-browed man. \"His talk is foolish and like that of a child.\"", "\"We will hear his talk which is like that of a child,\" said the square-browed man. \"And we will hear it, word for word, as he speaks it. Do you understand?\"", "Howkan understood, and Imber's eyes flashed, for he had witnessed the play between his sister's son and the man in authority. And then began the story, the epic of a bronze patriot which might well itself be wrought into bronze for the generations unborn. The crowd fell strangely silent, and the square-browed judge leaned head on hand and pondered his soul and the soul of his race. Only was heard the deep tones of Imber, rhythmically alternating with the shrill voice of the interpreter, and now and again, like the bell of the Lord, the wondering and meditative \"Hell\" of the red-haired man.", "\"I am Imber of the Whitefish people.\" So ran the interpretation of Howkan, whose inherent barbarism gripped hold of him, and who lost his mission culture and veneered civilization as he caught the savage ring and rhythm of old Imber's tale. \"My father was Otsbaok, a strong man. The land was warm with sunshine and gladness when I was a boy. The people did not hunger after strange things, nor hearken to new voices, and the ways of their fathers were their ways. The women found favor in the eyes of the young men, and the young men looked upon them with content. Babes hung at the breasts of the women, and they were heavy-hipped with increase of the tribe. Men were men in those days. In peace and plenty, and in war and famine, they were men.", "\"At that time there was more fish in the water than now, and more meat in the forest. Our dogs were wolves, warm with thick hides and hard to the frost and storm. And as with our dogs so with us, for we were likewise hard to the frost and storm. And when the Pellys came into our land we slew them and were slain. For we were men, we Whitefish, and our fathers and our fathers' fathers had fought against the Pellys and determined the bounds of the land.", "\"As I say, with our dogs, so with us. And one day came the first white man. He dragged himself, so, on hand and knee, in the snow. And his skin was stretched tight, and his bones were sharp beneath. Never was such a man, we thought, and we wondered of what strange tribe he was, and of its land. And he was weak, most weak, like a little child, so that we gave him a place by the fire, and warm furs to lie upon, and we gave him food as little children are given food.", "\"And with him was a dog, large as three of our dogs, and very weak. The hair of this dog was short, and not warm, and the tail was frozen so that the end fell off. And this strange dog we fed, and bedded by the fire, and fought from it our dogs, which else would have killed him. And what of the moose meat and the sun-dried salmon, the man and dog took strength to themselves; and what of the strength they became big and unafraid. And the man spoke loud words and laughed at the old men and young men, and looked boldly upon the maidens. And the dog fought with our dogs, and for all of his short hair and softness slew three of them in one day.", "\"When we asked the man concerning his people, he said, 'I have many brothers,' and laughed in a way that was not good. And when he was in his full strength he went away, and with him went Noda, daughter to the chief. First, after that, was one of our bitches brought to pup. And never was there such a breed of dogs,--big-headed, thick-jawed, and short-haired, and helpless. Well do I remember my father, Otsbaok, a strong man. His face was black with anger at such helplessness, and he took a stone, so, and so, and there was no more helplessness. And two summers after that came Noda back to us with a man-child in the hollow of her arm.", "\"And that was the beginning. Came a second white man, with short-haired dogs, which he left behind him when he went. And with him went six of our strongest dogs, for which, in trade, he had given Koo-So-Tee, my mother's brother, a wonderful pistol that fired with great swiftness six times. And Koo-So-Tee was very big, what of the pistol, and laughed at our bows and arrows. 'Woman's things,' he called them, and went forth against the bald-face grizzly, with the pistol in his hand. Now it be known that it is not good to hunt the bald-face with a pistol, but how were we to know? and how was Koo-So-Tee to know? So he went against the bald-face, very brave, and fired the pistol with great swiftness six times; and the bald-face but grunted and broke in his breast like it were an egg, and like honey from a bee's nest dripped the brains of Koo-So-Tee upon the ground. He was a good hunter, and there was no one to bring meat to his squaw and children. And we were bitter, and we said, 'That which for the white men is well, is for us not well.' And this be true. There be many white men and fat, but their ways have made us few and lean.", "\"Came the third white man, with great wealth of all manner of wonderful foods and things. And twenty of our strongest dogs he took from us in trade. Also, what of presents and great promises, ten of our young hunters did he take with him on a journey which fared no man knew where. It is said they died in the snow of the Ice Mountains where man has never been, or in the Hills of Silence which are beyond the edge of the earth. Be that as it may, dogs and young hunters were seen never again by the Whitefish people.", "\"And more white men came with the years, and ever, with pay and presents, they led the young men away with them. And sometimes the young men came back with strange tales of dangers and toils in the lands beyond the Pellys, and sometimes they did not come back. And we said: 'If they be unafraid of life, these white men, it is because they have many lives; but we be few by the Whitefish, and the young men shall go away no more.' But the young men did go away; and the young women went also; and we were very wroth.", "\"It be true, we ate flour, and salt pork, and drank tea which was a great delight; only, when we could not get tea, it was very bad and we became short of speech and quick of anger. So we grew to hunger for the things the white men brought in trade. Trade! trade! all the time was it trade! One winter we sold our meat for clocks that would not go, and watches with broken guts, and files worn smooth, and pistols without cartridges and worthless. And then came famine, and we were without meat, and two score died ere the break of spring.", "\"'Now are we grown weak,' we said; 'and the Pellys will fall upon us, and our bounds be overthrown.' But as it fared with us, so had it fared with the Pellys, and they were too weak to come against us.", "\"My father, Otsbaok, a strong man, was now old and very wise. And he spoke to the chief, saying: 'Behold, our dogs be worthless. No longer are they thick-furred and strong, and they die in the frost and harness. Let us go into the village and kill them, saving only the wolf ones, and these let us tie out in the night that they may mate with the wild wolves of the forest. Thus shall we have dogs warm and strong again.'", "\"And his word was harkened to, and we Whitefish became known for our dogs, which were the best in the land. But known we were not for ourselves. The best of our young men and women had gone away with the white men to wander on trail and river to far places. And the young women came back old and broken, as Noda had come, or they came not at all. And the young men came back to sit by our fires for a time, full of ill speech and rough ways, drinking evil drinks and gambling through long nights and days, with a great unrest always in their hearts, till the call of the white men came to them and they went away again to the unknown places. And they were without honor and respect, jeering the old-time customs and laughing in the faces of chief and shamans.", "\"As I say, we were become a weak breed, we Whitefish. We sold our warm skins and furs for tobacco and whiskey and thin cotton things that left us shivering in the cold. And the coughing sickness came upon us, and men and women coughed and sweated through the long nights, and the hunters on trail spat blood upon the snow. And now one, and now another, bled swiftly from the mouth and died. And the women bore few children, and those they bore were weak and given to sickness. And other sicknesses came to us from the white men, the like of which we had never known and could not understand. Smallpox, likewise measles, have I heard these sicknesses named, and we died of them as die the salmon in the still eddies when in the fall their eggs are spawned and there is no longer need for them to live.", "\"And yet, and here be the strangeness of it, the white men come as the breath of death; all their ways lead to death, their nostrils are filled with it; and yet they do not die. Theirs the whiskey, and tobacco, and short-haired dogs; theirs the many sicknesses, the smallpox and measles, the coughing and mouth-bleeding; theirs the white skin, and softness to the frost and storm; and theirs the pistols that shoot six times very swift and are worthless. And yet they grow fat on their many ills, and prosper, and lay a heavy hand over all the world and tread mightily upon its peoples. And their women, too, are soft as little babes, most breakable and never broken, the mothers of men. And out of all this softness, and sickness, and weakness, come strength, and power, and authority. They be gods, or devils, as the case may be. I do not know. What do I know, I, old Imber of the Whitefish? Only do I know that they are past understanding, these white men, far-wanderers and fighters over the earth that they be.", "\"As I say, the meat in the forest became less and less. It be true, the white man's gun is most excellent and kills a long way off; but of what worth the gun, when there is no meat to kill? When I was a boy on the Whitefish there was moose on every hill, and each year came the caribou uncountable. But now the hunter may take the trail ten days and not one moose gladden his eyes, while the caribou uncountable come no more at all. Small worth the gun, I say, killing a long way off, when there be nothing to kill.", "\"And I, Imber, pondered upon these things, watching the while the Whitefish, and the Pellys, and all the tribes of the land, perishing as perished the meat of the forest. Long I pondered. I talked with the shamans and the old men who were wise. I went apart that the sounds of the village might not disturb me, and I ate no meat so that my belly should not press upon me and make me slow of eye and ear. I sat long and sleepless in the forest, wide-eyed for the sign, my ears patient and keen for the word that was to come. And I wandered alone in the blackness of night to the river bank, where was wind-moaning and sobbing of water, and where I sought wisdom from the ghosts of old shamans in the trees and dead and gone.", "\"And in the end, as in a vision, came to me the short-haired and detestable dogs, and the way seemed plain. By the wisdom of Otsbaok, my father and a strong man, had the blood of our own wolf-dogs been kept clean, wherefore had they remained warm of hide and strong in the harness. So I returned to my village and made oration to the men. 'This be a tribe, these white men,' I said. 'A very large tribe, and doubtless there is no longer meat in their land, and they are come among us to make a new land for themselves. But they weaken us, and we die. They are a very hungry folk. Already has our meat gone from us, and it were well, if we would live, that we deal by them as we have dealt by their dogs.'", "\"And further oration I made, counselling fight. And the men of the Whitefish listened, and some said one thing, and some another, and some spoke of other and worthless things, and no man made brave talk of deeds and war. But while the young men were weak as water and afraid, I watched that the old men sat silent, and that in their eyes fires came and went. And later, when the village slept and no one knew, I drew the old men away into the forest and made more talk. And now we were agreed, and we remembered the good young days, and the free land, and the times of plenty, and the gladness and sunshine; and we called ourselves brothers, and swore great secrecy, and a mighty oath to cleanse the land of the evil breed that had come upon it. It be plain we were fools, but how were we to know, we old men of the Whitefish?", "\"And to hearten the others, I did the first deed. I kept guard upon the Yukon till the first canoe came down. In it were two white men, and when I stood upright upon the bank and raised my hand they changed their course and drove in to me. And as the man in the bow lifted his head, so, that he might know wherefore I wanted him, my arrow sang through the air straight to his throat, and he knew. The second man, who held paddle in the stern, had his rifle half to his shoulder when the first of my three spear-casts smote him.", "\"'These be the first,' I said, when the old men had gathered to me. 'Later we will bind together all the old men of all the tribes, and after that the young men who remain strong, and the work will become easy.'", "\"And then the two dead white men we cast into the river. And of the canoe, which was a very good canoe, we made a fire, and a fire, also, of the things within the canoe. But first we looked at the things, and they were pouches of leather which we cut open with our knives. And inside these pouches were many papers, like that from which thou hast read, O Howkan, with markings on them which we marvelled at and could not understand. Now, I am become wise, and I know them for the speech of men as thou hast told me.\"", "A whisper and buzz went around the courtroom when Howkan finished interpreting the affair of the canoe, and one man's voice spoke up: \"That was the lost '91 mail, Peter James and Delaney bringing it in and last spoken at Le Barge by Matthews going out.\" The clerk scratched steadily away, and another paragraph was added to the history of the North.", "\"There be little more,\" Imber went on slowly. \"It be there on the paper, the things we did. We were old men, and we did not understand. Even I, Imber, do not now understand. Secretly we slew, and continued to slay, for with our years we were crafty and we had learned the swiftness of going without haste. When white men came among us with black looks and rough words, and took away six of the young men with irons binding them helpless, we knew we must slay wider and farther. And one by one we old men departed up river and down to the unknown lands. It was a brave thing. Old we were, and unafraid, but the fear of far places is a terrible fear to men who are old.", "\"So we slew, without haste and craftily. On the Chilcoot and in the Delta we slew, from the passes to the sea, wherever the white men camped or broke their trails. It be true, they died, but it was without worth. Ever did they come over the mountains, ever did they grow and grow, while we, being old, became less and less. I remember, by the Caribou Crossing, the camp of a white man. He was a very little white man, and three of the old men came upon him in his sleep. And the next day I came upon the four of them. The white man alone still breathed, and there was breath in him to curse me once and well before he died.", "\"And so it went, now one old man, and now another. Sometimes the word reached us long after of how they died, and sometimes it did not reach us. And the old men of the other tribes were weak and afraid, and would not join with us. As I say, one by one, till I alone was left. I am Imber, of the Whitefish people. My father was Otsbaok, a strong man. There are no Whitefish now. Of the old men I am the last. The young men and young women are gone away, some to live with the Pellys, some with the Salmons, and more with the white men. I am very old, and very tired, and it being vain fighting the Law, as thou sayest, Howkan, I am come seeking the Law.\"", "But Imber was dreaming. The square-browed judge likewise dreamed, and all his race rose up before him in a mighty phantasmagoria--his steel-shod, mail-clad race, the lawgiver and world-maker among the families of men. He saw it dawn red-flickering across the dark forests and sullen seas; he saw it blaze, bloody and red, to full and triumphant noon; and down the shaded slope he saw the blood-red sands dropping into night. And through it all he observed the Law, pitiless and potent, ever unswerving and ever ordaining, greater than the motes of men who fulfilled it or were crushed by it, even as it was greater than he, his heart speaking for softness.", "Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without permission and without paying copyright royalties.

The latter came from an old family of lawyers named Gayard and this relationship makes me a descendant of General Delcambre, one of the heroes of the retreat from Russia. His granddaughter married Count Durrieu of the _Acad\u00e9mie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres_. My great-aunt was born in the provinces in 1781, but she was adopted by a childless aunt and uncle who made their home in Paris. He was a wealthy lawyer and they lived magnificently.", "My great-aunt was a precocious child--she walked at nine months--and she became a woman of keen intellect and brilliant attainments. She remembered perfectly the customs of the _Ancien R\u00e9gime_, and she enjoyed telling about them, as well as about the Revolution, the Reign of Terror, and the times that followed. Her family was ruined by the Revolution and the slight, frail, young girl undertook to earn her living by giving lessons in French, on the pianoforte--the instrument was a novelty then--in singing, painting, embroidery, in fact in everything she knew and in much that she did not. If she did not know, she learned then and there so that she could teach. Afterwards, she married one of her cousins. As she had no children of her own, she brought one of her nieces from Champagne and adopted her. This niece was my mother, Clemence Collin. The Massons were about to retire from business with a comfortable fortune, when they lost practically everything within two weeks, in a panic, saving just enough to live decently. Shortly after this my mother married my father, a minor official in the Department of the Interior. My great-uncle died of a broken heart some months before my birth on October 9, 1835. My father died of consumption on the thirty-first of the following December, just a year to a day after his marriage.", "Thus the two women were both left widows, poorly provided for, weighed down by sad memories, and with the care of a delicate child. In fact I was so delicate that the doctors held out little hope of my living, and on their advice I was left in the country with my nurse until I was two years old.", "While my aunt had had a remarkable education, my mother had not been so widely taught. But she made up for any lack by the display of an imagination and an eager power of assimilation which bordered on the miraculous. She often told me about an uncle who was very fond of her--he had been ruined in the cause of Philippe Egalit\u00e9. This uncle was an artist, but he was, nevertheless, passionately fond of music. He had even built with his own hands a concert organ on which he used to play. My mother used to sit between his knees and, while he amused himself by running his fingers through her splendid black hair, he would talk to her about art, music, painting--beauty in every form. So she got it into her head that if she ever had sons of her own, the first should be a musician, the second a painter, and the third a sculptor. As a result, when I came home from the nurse, she was not greatly surprised that I began to listen to every noise and to every sound; that I made the doors creak, and would plant myself in front of the clocks to hear them strike. My special delight was the music of the tea-kettle--a large one which was hung before the fire in the drawing-room every morning. Seated nearby on a small stool, I used to wait with a lively curiosity for the first murmurs of its gentle and variegated _crescendo_, and the appearance of a microscopic oboe which gradually increased its song until it was silenced by the kettle boiling. Berlioz must have heard that oboe as well as I, for I rediscovered it in the \"Ride to Hell\" in his _La Damnation de Faust_.", "At the same time I was learning to read. When I was two-years-and-a-half old, they placed me in front of a small piano which had not been opened for several years. Instead of drumming at random as most children of that age would have done, I struck the notes one after another, going on only when the sound of the previous note had died away. My great-aunt taught me the names of the notes and got a tuner to put the piano in order. While the tuning was going on, I was playing in the next room, and they were utterly astonished when I named the notes as they were sounded. I was not told all these details--I remember them perfectly.", "I was taught by Le Carpentier's method and I finished it in a month. They couldn't let a little monkey like that work away at the piano, and I cried like a lost soul when they closed the instrument. Then they left it open and put a small stool in front of it. From time to time I would leave my playthings and climb up to drum out whatever came into my head. Gradually, my great-aunt, who fortunately had an excellent foundation in music, taught me how to hold my hands properly so that I did not acquire the gross faults which are so difficult to correct later on. But they did not know what sort of music to give me. That written especially for children is, as a rule, entirely melody and the part for the left hand is uninteresting. I refused to learn it. \"The bass doesn't sing,\" I said, in disgust.", "Then they searched the old masters, in Haydn and Mozart, for things sufficiently easy for me to handle. At five I was playing small sonatas correctly, with good interpretation and excellent precision. But I consented to play them only before listeners capable of appreciating them. I have read in a biographical sketch that I was threatened with whippings to make me play. That is absolutely false; but it was necessary to tell me that there was a lady in the audience who was an excellent musician and had fastidious tastes. I would not play for those who did not know.", "As for the threat of whippings, that must be relegated to the realm of legends with the one that Garcia punished his daughters to make them learn to sing. Madame Viardot expressly told me that neither she nor her sister was abused by their father and that they learned music without realizing it, just as they learned to talk.", "But in spite of my surprising progress my teacher did not foresee what my future was to be. \"When he is fifteen,\" she said, \"if he can write a dance, I shall be satisfied.\" It was just at this time, however, that I began to write music. I wrote waltzes and galops--the galop was fashionable at that period; it ran to rather ordinary musical motives and mine were no exception to the rule. Liszt had to show by his _Galop Chromatique_ the distinction that genius can give to the most commonplace themes. My waltzes were better. As has always been the case with me, I was already composing the music directly on paper without working it out on the piano. The waltzes were too difficult for my hands, so a friend of the family, a sister of the singer Geraldy, was kind enough to play them for me.", "I have looked over these little compositions lately. They are insignificant, but it is impossible to find a technical error in them. Such precision was remarkable for a child who had no idea of the science of harmony. About that time some one had the notion that I should hear an orchestra. So they took me to a symphony concert and my mother held me in her arms near the door. Until then I had only heard single violins and their tone had not pleased me. But the impression of the orchestra was entirely different and I listened with delight to a passage played by a quartet, when, suddenly, came a blast from the brass instruments--the trumpets, trombones and cymbals. I broke into loud cries, \"Make them stop. They prevent my hearing the music.\" They had to take me out.", "When I was seven, I passed out of my great-aunt's hands into Stamaty's. He was surprised at the way my education in music had been directed and he expressed this in a small work in which he discussed the necessity of making a correct start. In my case, he said, there was nothing to do but to perfect.", "Stamaty was Kalkbrenner's best pupil and the propagator of the method he had invented. This method was based on the _guide main_, so I was put to work on it. The preface to Kalkbrenner's method, in which he relates the beginnings of his invention, is exceedingly interesting. This invention consisted of a rod placed in front of the keyboard. The forearm rested on this rod in such a way that all muscular action save that of the hand was suppressed. This system is excellent for teaching the young pianist how to play pieces written for the harpsichord or the first pianofortes where the keys responded to slight pressure; but it is inadequate for modern works and instruments. It is the way one ought to begin, for it develops firmness of the fingers and suppleness of the wrist, and, by easy stages, adds the weight of the forearm and of the whole arm. But in our day it has become the practice to begin at the end. We learn the elements of the fugue from Sebastian Bach's _Wohltemperirte Klavier_, the piano from the works of Schumann and Liszt, and harmony and instrumentation from Richard Wagner. All too often we waste our efforts, just as singers who learn r\u00f4les and rush on the stage before they know how to sing ruin their voices in a short time.", "Firmness of the fingers is not the only thing that one learns from Kalkbrenner's method, for there is also a refinement of the quality of the sound made by the fingers alone, a valuable resource which is unusual in our day.", "Unfortunately, this school invented as well continuous _legato_, which is both false and monotonous; the abuse of nuances, and a mania for continual _expressio_ used with no discrimination. All this was opposed to my natural feelings, and I was unable to conform to it. They reproached me by saying that I would never get a really fine effect--to which I was entirely indifferent.", "When I was ten, my teacher decided that I was sufficiently prepared to give a concert in the Salle Pleyel, so I played there, accompanied by an Italian orchestra, with Tilmant as the conductor. I gave Beethoven's _Concerto in C minor_ and one of Mozart's concertos in B flat. There was some question of my playing at the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Concerts du Conservatoire, and there was even a rehearsal. But Seghers, who afterwards founded the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 St. C\u00e9cile, was a power in the affairs of the orchestra. He detested Stamaty and told him that the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 was not organized to play children's accompaniments. My mother felt hurt and wanted to hear nothing more of it.", "After my first concert, which was a brilliant success, my teacher wanted me to give others, but my mother did not wish me to have a career as an infant prodigy. She had higher ambitions and was unwilling for me to continue in concert work for fear of injuring my health. The result was that a coolness sprang up between my teacher and me which ended our relations.", "At that time my mother made a remark which was worthy of Cornelia. One day some one remonstrated with her for letting me play Beethoven's sonatas. \"What music will he play when he is twenty?\" she was asked. \"He will play his own,\" was her reply.", "The greatest benefit I got from my experience with Stamaty was my acquaintance with Maleden, whom he gave me as my teacher in composition. Maleden was born in Limoges, as his accent always showed. He was thin and long-haired, a kind and timid soul, but an incomparable teacher. He had gone to Germany in his youth to study with a certain Gottfried Weber, the inventor of a system which Maleden brought back with him and perfected. He made it a wonderful tool with which to get to the depths of music--a light for the darkest corners. In this system the chords are not considered in and for themselves--as fifths, sixths, sevenths--but in relation to the pitch of the scale on which they appear. The chords acquire different characteristics according to the place they occupy, and, as a result, certain things are explained which are, otherwise, inexplicable. This method is taught in the Ecole Niedermeuer, but I don't know that it is taught elsewhere.", "Maleden was extremely anxious to become a professor at the Conservatoire. As the result of powerful influence, Auber was about to sign Maleden's appointment, when, in his scrupulous honesty, he thought he ought to write and warn him that his method differed entirely from that taught in the institution. Auber was frightened and Maleden was not admitted.", "Our lessons were often very stormy. From time to time certain questions came up on which I could not agree with him. He would then take me quietly by the ear, bend my head and hold my ear to the table for a minute or two. Then, he would ask whether I had changed my mind. As I had not, he would think it over and very often he would confess that I was right.", "\"Your childhood,\" Gounod once told me, \"wasn't musical.\" He was wrong, for he did not know the many tokens of my childhood. Many of my attempts are unfinished--to say nothing of those I destroyed--but among them are songs, choruses, cantatas, and overtures, none of which will ever see the light. Oblivion will enshroud these gropings after effect, for they are of no interest to the public. Among these scribblings I have found some notes written in pencil when I was four. The date on them leaves no doubt about the time of their production.", "I cannot let the old Conservatoire in the Rue Berg\u00e8re go without paying it a last farewell, for I loved it deeply as we all love the things of our youth. I loved its antiquity, the utter absence of any modern note, and its atmosphere of other days. I loved that absurd court with the wailing notes of sopranos and tenors, the rattling of pianos, the blasts of trumpets and trombones, the arpeggios of clarinets, all uniting to form that ultra-polyphone which some of our composers have tried to attain--but without success. Above all I loved the memories of my education in music which I obtained in that ridiculous and venerable palace, long since too small for the pupils who thronged there from all parts of the world.", "I was fourteen when Stamaty, my piano teacher, introduced me to Benoist, the teacher of the organ, an excellent and charming man, familiarly known as \"Father Benoist.\" They put me in front of the keyboard, but I was badly frightened, and the sounds I made were so extraordinary that all the pupils shouted with laughter. I was received at the Conservatoire as an \"auditor.\"", "So there I was only admitted to the honor of listening to others. I was extremely painstaking, however, and I never lost a note or one of the teacher's words. I worked and thought at home, studying hard on Sebastian Bach's _Wohltemperirte Klavier_. All of the pupils, however, were not so industrious. One day, when they had all failed and Benoist, as a result, had nothing to do, he put me at the organ. This time no one laughed and I at once became a regular pupil. At the end of the year I won the second prize. I would have had the first except for my youth and the inconvenience of having me leave a class where I needed to stay longer.", "That same year Madeleine Brohan won the first prize in comedy. She competed with a selection from _Misanthrope_, and Mlle. Jouassin gave the other part of the dialogue. Mlle. Jouassin's technique was the better, but Madeleine Brohan was so wonderful in beauty and voice that she carried off the prize. The award made a great uproar. To-day, in such a case, the prize would be divided. Mlle. Jouassin won her prize the following year. After leaving school, she accepted and held for a long time an important place at the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise.", "Benoist was a very ordinary organist, but an admirable teacher. A veritable galaxy of talent came from his class. He had little to say, but as his taste was refined and his judgment sure, nothing he said lacked weight or authority. He collaborated in several ballets for the Op\u00e9ra and that gave him a good deal of work to do. It sounds incredible, but he used to bring his \"work\" to class and scribble away on his orchestration while his pupils played the organ. This did not prevent his listening and looking after them. He would leave his work and make appropriate comments as though he had no other thought.", "In addition to his ballets, Benoist did other little odd jobs for the Op\u00e9ra. As a result one day, without thinking, he gave me the key to a deep secret. In his famous _Trait\u00e9 d'Instrumentation_ Berlioz spoke of his admiration for a passage in Sacchini's _Oedipus \u00e0 Colone_. Two clarinets are heard in descending thirds of real charm just before the words, \"_Je connus la charmante Eriphyle._\" Berlioz was enthusiastic and wrote:", "\"We might believe that we really see Eriphyle chastely kiss his eyes. It is admirable. And yet,\" he adds, \"there is no trace of this effect in Sacchini's score.\"", "Now Sacchini, for some reason or other which I do not know, did not use clarinets once in the whole score. Benoist was commissioned to add them when the work was revived, as he told me as we were chatting one day. Berlioz did not know this, and Benoist, who had not read Berlioz's _Trait\u00e9_, knew nothing of the romantic musician's enthusiastic admiration of his work. These happily turned thirds, although they weren't Sacchini's, were, none the less, an excellent innovation.", "Benoist was less happy when he was asked to put some life into Bellini's _Romeo_ by using earsplitting outbursts of drums, cymbals, and brass. During the same noise-loving period Costa, in London, gave Mozart's _Don Juan_ the same treatment. He let loose throughout the opera the trombones which the author intentionally reserved for the end. Benoist ought to have refused to do such a barbarous piece of work. However, it had no effect in preventing the failure of a worthless piece, staged at great expense by the management which had rejected Les Troyens.", "I was fifteen when I entered Hal\u00e9vy's class. I had already completed the study of harmony, counterpoint and fugue under Maleden's direction. As I have said, his method was that taught at the Ecole Niedermeuer. Faure, Messager, Perilhou, and Gigot were trained there and they taught this method in turn. My class-work consisted in making attempts at vocal and instrumental music and orchestration. My _R\u00eaverie_, _La Feuille de Peuplier_ and many other things first appeared there. They have been entirely forgotten, and rightly, for my work was very uneven.", "At the end of his career Hal\u00e9vy was constantly writing opera and op\u00e9ra-comique which added nothing to his fame and which disappeared never to be revived after a respectable number of performances. He was entirely absorbed in his work and, as a result, he neglected his classes a good deal. He came only when he had time. The pupils, however, came just the same and gave each other instruction which was far less indulgent than the master's, for his greatest fault was an overweening good nature. Even when he was at class he couldn't protect himself from self-seekers. Singers of all sorts, male and female, came for a hearing. One day it was Marie Cabel, still youthful and dazzling both in voice and beauty. Other days impossible tenors wasted his time. When the master sent word that he wasn't coming--this happened often--I used to go to the library, and there, as a matter of fact, I completed my education. The amount of music, ancient and modern, I devoured is beyond belief.", "But it wasn't enough just to read music--I needed to hear it. Of course there was the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Concerts, but it was a Paradise, guarded by an angel with a flaming sword, in the form of a porter named Lescot. It was his duty to prevent the profane defiling the sanctuary. Lescot was fond of me and appreciated my keen desire to hear the orchestra. As a result he made his rounds as slowly as possible in order to put me out only as a last resort. Fortunately for me, Marcelin de Fresne gave me a place in his box, which I was permitted to occupy for several years.", "I used to read and study the symphonies before I heard them and I saw grave defects in the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9's vaunted execution. No one would stand them now, but then they passed unnoticed. I was na\u00efve and lacked discretion, and so I often pointed out these defects. It can be easily imagined what vials of wrath were poured on me.", "As far as the public was concerned, the great success of these concerts was due to the incomparable charm of the depth of tone, which was attributed to the hall. The members of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 believed this, too, and they would let no other orchestra be heard there. This state of affairs lasted until Anton Rubinstein got permission from the Minister of Fine Arts to give a concert there, accompanied by the Colonne orchestra. The Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 fretted and fumed at this and threatened to give up its series of concerts. But the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 was overruled and the concert was given. To the general surprise it was seen that another orchestra in the same hall produced an entirely different effect. The depth of tone which had been appreciated so highly, it was found, was due to the famous Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 itself, to the character of the instruments and the execution.", "Nevertheless, the hall is excellent, although it is no longer adequate for the presentation of modern compositions. But it is a marvellous place for the numerous concerts given by virtuosi, both singers and instrumentalists, accompanied by an orchestra, and for chamber music. Finally, the hall where France was introduced to the masterpieces of Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven, whose influence has been so profound, is a historic place.", "Numerous improvements in the administration of the Conservatoire have been introduced during the last few years. On the other hand, old and honored customs have disappeared and we can but regret their loss. From Auber's time on there was a _pension_ connected with the Conservatoire. Here the young singers who came from the provinces at eighteen found board and lodging, a regular life, and a protection from the temptations of a large city, so dangerous to fresh young voices. Bouhy, Lassalle, Capoul, Gailhard and many others who have made the French stage famous came from this _pension_.", "We also used to have dramatic recitals which were excellent both for the performers and the audiences as they gave works which were not in the usual repertoire. In these recitals they gave M\u00e9hul's _Joseph_, which had disappeared from the stage for a long time. The beautiful choruses sung by the fresh voices of the pupils made such a success and the whole work was so enthusiastically applauded that it was revived at the Op\u00e9ra-Comique and won back a success which it has never lost. We also heard there Gluck's _Orph\u00e9e_ long before that masterpiece was revived at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Lyrique. Then there was M\u00e9hul's _Irato_, a curious and charming work which the Op\u00e9ra took up afterwards. And there, too, they gave the last act of Rossini's _Otello_. The tempest in that act gave me the idea of the one which rumbles through the second act of _Samson_.", "When the hall was reconstructed, the stage was destroyed so that such performances are impossible. But to make up for this, they installed a concert organ, a necessary adjunct for musical performances.", "Finally, in Auber's day and even in that of Ambroise Thomas, the director was master. No one had dreamed of creating a committee, which, under cover of the director's responsibility, would strangely diminish his authority. The only benefit from the new system has been the end of the incessant war which the musical critics waged on the director. But that did no harm, either to the director or to the school, for the latter kept on growing to such an extent that it ought to have been enlarged long ago. The committee plan has won and the incident is closed. One may only hope that steps will be taken to make possible an increase in the number of pupils since so many candidates apply each year and so few are chosen.", "As everyone knows, we have been struck by a perfect mania for reforms, so there is no harm in proposing one for the Conservatoire. Foreign conservatoires have been studied and they want to introduce some of their features here. As a matter of fact, some of the foreign conservatoires are housed in magnificent palaces and their curricula are elaborated with a care worthy of admiration. Whether they turn out better pupils than we do is an open question. It is beyond dispute, however, that many young foreigners come to us for their education.", "Some of the reformers are scandalized at the sight of a musician in charge of a school where elocution is taught. They forget that a musician may also be a man of letters--the present director combines these qualifications--and that it is improbable that it will be different in the future. The teachers of elocution have always been the best that could be found. Although M. Faure is a musician, he has known how to bring back the classes in tragedy to their original purpose. For a time they tended towards an objectionable modernism, for they substituted in their competitions modern prose for the classic verse. And the study of the latter is very profitable.", "Not only is there no harm in this union of elocution and music, but it would be useful if singers and composers would take advantage of it to familiarize themselves with the principles of diction, which, in my opinion, are indispensable to both. Instead, they distrust melody. Declamation is no longer wanted in operas, and the singers make the works incomprehensible by not articulating the words. The composers tend along the same lines, for they give no indication or direction of how they want the words spoken. All this is regrettable and should be reformed.", "As you see, I object to the mania for reform and end by suggesting reforms myself. Well, one must be of one's own time, and there is no escaping the contagion.", "Everything in my youth seemed calculated to keep me far removed from romanticism. Those about me talked only of the great classics and I saw them welcome Ponsard's _Lucrece_ as a sort of Minerva whose lance was to route Victor Hugo and his foul crew, of whom they never spoke save with detestation.", "Who was it, I wonder, who had the happy idea of giving me, elegantly bound, the first volumes of Victor Hugo's poems? I have forgotten who it was, but I remember what joy the vibrations of his lyre gave me. Until that time poetry had seemed to me something cold, respectable and far-away, and it was much later that the living beauty of our classics was revealed to me. I found myself at once stirred to the depths, and, as my temperament is essentially musical in everything, I began to sing them.", "People have told me _ad nauseam_ (and they still tell me so) that beautiful verse is inimical to music, or rather that music is inimical to good verse; that music demands ordinary verse, rhymed prose, rather than verse, which is malleable and reducible as the composer wishes. This generalization is assuredly true, if the music is written first and then adapted to the words, but that is not the ideal harmony between two arts which are made to supplement each other. Do not the rhythmic and sonorous passages of verse naturally call for song to set them off, since singing is but a better method of declaiming them? I made some attempts at this and some of those which have been preserved are: _Puisque ici bas toute \u00e2me_, _Le Pas d'armes du roi Jean_, and _La Cloche_. They were ridiculed at the time, but destined to some success later. Afterwards I continued with _Si tu veux faisons un r\u00e9ve_, which Madame Carvalho sang a good deal, _Soir\u00e9e en mer_, and many others.", "The older I grew the greater became my devotion to Hugo. I waited impatiently for each new work of the poet and I devoured it as soon as it appeared. If I heard about me the spiteful criticisms of irritating critics, I was consoled by talking to Berlioz who honored me with his friendship and whose admiration for Hugo equalled mine. In the meantime my literary education was improving, and I made the acquaintance of the classics and found immortal beauties in them. My admiration for the classics, however, did not diminish my regard for Hugo, for I never could see why it was unfaithfulness to him not to despise Racine. It was fortunate for me that this was my view, for I have seen the most fiery romanticists, like Meurice and Vacquerie, revert to Racine in their later years, and repair the links in a golden chain which should never have been broken.", "The Empire fell and Victor Hugo came back to Paris. So I was going to have a chance of realizing my dream of seeing him and hearing his voice! But I dreaded meeting him almost as much as I wished to do so. Like Rossini Victor Hugo received his friends every evening. He came forward with both hands outstretched and told me what pleasure it was for him to see me at his house. Everything whirled around me!", "\"I cannot say the same to you,\" I answered. \"I wish I were somewhere else.\" He laughed heartily and showed that he knew how to overcome my bashfulness. I waited to hear some of the conversation which, according to my preconceived ideas, would be in the style of his latest romance. However, it was entirely different; simple polished phrases, entirely logical, came from that \"mouth of mystery.\"", "I went to Hugo's evenings as often as possible, for I never could drink my fill of the presence of the hero of my youthful dreams. I had occasion to note to what an extent a fiery republican, a modern Juvenal, whose verses branded \"kings\" as if with a red hot iron, in his private life was susceptible to their flattery. The Emperor of Brazil had called on him, and the next day he could not stop talking about it constantly. Rather ostentatiously he called him \"Don Pedro d'Alcantara.\" In French this would be \"M. Pierre du Pont.\" Spanish inherently gives such florid sounds to ordinary names. This florid style is not frequent in French, and that is precisely what Corneille and Victor Hugo succeeded in giving it.", "\"As long as Mlle. Bertin was alive,\" he told me, \"I would never permit _La Esmeralda_ to be set to music; but if some musician should now ask for this poem, I would be glad to let him have it.\"", "The invitation was obvious. Yet, as is generally known, this dramatic and lyric adaptation of the famous romance is not particularly happy. I was much embarrassed and I pretended not to understand, but I never dared to go to Hugo's house again.", "Years passed. In 1881 a subscription was taken up to erect a statue to the author of _La L\u00e9gende des Si\u00e8cles_, and they began to plan celebrations for its dedication, particularly a big affair at the Trocad\u00e9ro. My imagination took fire at the idea, and I wrote my _Hymne \u00e0 Victor Hugo_.", "As is well known, the master knew nothing at all about music, and the same was true of those around him. It is a matter of conjecture how the master and his followers happened to mistake some absurd and formless motif for one of Beethoven's sublime inspirations. Victor Hugo adapted the beautiful verses of _Stella_ to this halting motif. It was published as an appendix in the _Ch\u00e2timents_, with a remark about the union of two geniuses, the fusion of the verse of a great poet with the _admirable_ verse of a great musician. And the poet would have Mme. Drouet play this marvellous music on the piano from time to time! _Tristia Herculis!_", "As I wanted to put in my hymn something peculiar to Victor Hugo, which could not possibly be attributed to anyone else, I tried to introduce this motif of which he was so fond. And, by means of numerous tricks which every musician has up his sleeve, I managed to give it the form and character which it had lacked.", "The subscription did not go fast enough to suit the master, and he had it stopped. So I put my hymn in a drawer and waited for a better opportunity.", "About this time M. Bruneau, the father of the well-known composer, conceived the idea of giving spring concerts at the Trocad\u00e9ro. Bruneau came to see me and asked me if I had some unpublished work which I would let him have. This was an excellent occasion for the presentation of my _Hymne_, as it had been written with the Trocad\u00e9ro in mind. The performance was decided on and Victor Hugo was invited to come and hear it.", "The performance was splendid--a large orchestra, the magnificent organ, eight harps, and eight trumpets sounding their flourishes in the organ loft, and a large chorus for the peroration of such splendor that it was compared to the set pieces at the close of a display of fireworks. The reception and ovation which the crowd gave the great poet, who rarely appeared in public, was beyond description. The honeyed incense of the organ, harps and trumpets was new to him and pleased his Olympian nostrils.", "\"Dine with me to-night,\" he said to me. And from that day on, I often dined with him informally with M. and Mme. Lockrou, Meurice, Vacquerie and other close friends. The fare was delightful and unpretentious, and the conversation was the same. The master sat at the head of the table, with his grandson and granddaughter on either side, saying little but always something apropos. Thanks to his vigor, his strong sonorous voice, and his quiet good humor, he did not seem like an old man, but rather like an ageless and immortal being, whom Time would never touch. His presence was just Jove-like enough to inspire respect without chilling his followers. These small gatherings, which I fully appreciated, are among the most precious recollections of my life.", "Time, alas, goes on, and that fine intellect, which had ever been unclouded, began to give signs of aberration. One day he said to an Italian delegation, \"The French are Italians; the Italians are French. French and Italians ought to go to Africa together and found the United States of Europe.\"", "Those who saw them will never forget his grandiose funeral ceremonies, that casket under the Arc de Triomphe, covered with a veil of crape, and that immense crowd which paid homage to the greatest lyric poet of the century.", "There was a committee to make musical preparations and I was a member. The most extraordinary ideas were proposed. One man wanted to have the _Marseillaise_ in a minor key. Another wanted violins, for \"violins produce an excellent effect in the open air.\" Naturally we got nowhere.", "The great procession started in perfect order, but, as in all long processions, gaps occurred. I was astonished to find myself in the middle of the Champs Elys\u00e9es, in a wide open space, with no one near me but Ferdinand de Lesseps, Paul Bert, and a member of the Acad\u00e9mie, whose name I shall not mention as he is worthy of all possible respect.", "De Lesseps was then at the height of his glory, and from time to time applause greeted him as he passed.", "Young musicians often complain, and not without reason, of the difficulties of their careers. It may, perhaps, be useful to remind them that their elders have not always had beds of roses, and that too often they have had to breast both wind and sea after spending their best years in port, unable to make a start. These obstacles frequently are the result of the worst sort of malignity, when it is for the best interest of everyone--both of the theatres which rebuff them, and the public which ignores them--that they be permitted to set out under full sail.", "Our real duty--and it is a true kindness--is not to encourage them (beginners) but to discourage them. In art a vocation is everything, and a vocation needs no one, for God aids. What use is it to encourage them and their efforts when the public obstinately refuses to pay any attention to them? If an act is ordered from one of them, it fails to go. Two or three years later the same thing is tried again with the same result. No theatre, even if it were four times as heavily subsidized as the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Lyrique, could continue to exist on such resources. So the result is that they turn to accredited talent and call on such men from outside as Gounod, Felicien David and Victor Mass\u00e9. The younger composers at once shout treason and scandal. Then, they select masterpieces by Mozart and Weber and there are the same outcries and recriminations. In the final analysis where are these young composers of genius? Who are they and what are their names? Let them go to the orchestra and hear _Le Nozze di Figaro_, _Ob\u00e9ron_, _Freischutz_ and _Orph\u00e9e_ ... we are doing something for them by placing such models before them.", "The young composers who were thus politely invited to be seated included, among others, Bizet, Delibes, Massenet, and the writer of these lines. Massenet and I would have been satisfied with writing a ballet for the Op\u00e9ra. He proposed the _Rat Catcher_ from an old German tale, while I proposed _Une nuit de Cl\u00e9op\u00e2tra_ on the text of Th\u00e9ophile Gautier. They refused us the honor, and, when they consented to order a ballet from Delibes, they did not dare to trust him with the whole work. They let him do only one act and the other was given to a Hungarian composer. As the experiment succeeded, they allowed Delibes to write, without assistance, his marvellous _Copp\u00e9lia_. But Delibes had the legitimate ambition of writing a grand opera. He never reached so far.", "Bizet and I were great friends and we told each other all our troubles. \"You're less unfortunate than I am,\" he used to tell me. \"You can do something besides things for the stage. I can't. That's my only resource.\"", "When Bizet put on the delightful _P\u00eacheurs de Perles_--he was helped by powerful influences--there was a general outcry and an outbreak of abuse. The Devil himself straight from Hell would not have received a worse reception. Later on, as we know, _Carmen_ was received in the same way.", "I was, indeed, able to do something beside work for the stage, and it was just that which closed the stage to me. I was a writer of symphonies, an organist and a pianist, so how could I be capable of writing an opera! The qualities which go to make a pianist were in a particularly bad light in the greenroom. Bizet played the piano admirably, but he never dared to play in public for fear of making his position worse.", "I suggested to Carvalho that I write a _Macbeth_ for Madame Viardot. Naturally enough he preferred to put on Verdi's _Macbeth_. It was an utter failure and cost him thirty thousand francs.", "They tried to interest a certain princess, a patron of the arts, in my behalf. \"What,\" she replied, \"isn't he satisfied with his position? He plays the organ at the Madeleine and the piano at my house. Isn't that enough for him?\"", "But that wasn't enough for me, and to overcome the obstacles, I caused a scandal. At the age of twenty-eight I competed for the _Prix de Rome_! They did not give it to me on the ground that I didn't need it, but the day after the award, Auber, who was very fond of me, asked Carvalho for a libretto for me. Carvalho gave me _Le Timbre d'Argent_, which he didn't know what to do with as several musicians had refused to touch it. There were good reasons for this, for, despite an excellent foundation for the music, the libretto had serious faults. I demanded that Barbier and Carr\u00e9, the authors, should make important changes, which they did at once. Then, I retired to the heights of Louveciennes and in two months wrote the score of the five acts which the work had at first.", "I had to wait two years before Carvalho would consent to hear the music. Finally, worn out by my importunities, they decided to get rid of me, so Carvalho invited me to dine with him and to bring my score. After dinner I went to the piano. Carvalho was on one side and Madame Carvalho on the other. Both were very pleasant and charming, but the real meaning of this friendliness did not escape me.", "They had no doubts about what awaited them. Both really loved music and little by little they fell under the spell. Serious attention succeeded the false friendliness. At the end they were enthusiastic. Carvalho declared that he would have the study of the work begun as soon as possible; it was a masterpiece; it would have a great success, but to assure this success, Madame Carvalho must sing the principal part.", "Now the principal part in _Le Timbre d'Argent_ is that of a dancer and the singer's part is greatly subordinate. To remedy this they decided to develop the part. Barbier invented a pretty situation to bring in the passage _Bonheur est chose leg\u00e8re_, but that wasn't enough. Barbier and Carr\u00e9 racked their brains without finding any solution of the difficulty, for on the stage as elsewhere there are problems that can't be solved.", "Between times they tried to find a dancer of the first rank. Finally, they found one who had recently left the Op\u00e9ra, although still at the height of her beauty and talent. And they continued to seek a way to make the part of H\u00e9l\u00e8ne worthy of Madame Carvalho.", "The famous director had one mania. He wanted to collaborate in every work he staged. Even a work hallowed by time and success had to bear his mark; much greater were his reasons for interpolating in a new work. He would announce brusquely that the period or the country in which the action of the work took place must be changed. He tormented us for a long time to make the dancer into a singer on his wife's account. Later, he wanted to introduce a second dancer. With the exception of the prologue and epilogue the action of the piece takes place in a dream, and he took upon himself the invention of the most bizarre combinations. He even proposed to me one day to introduce wild animals. Another time he wanted to cut out all the music with the exception of the choruses and the dancer's part, and have the rest played by a dramatic company. Later, as they were rehearsing Hamlet at the Op\u00e9ra and it was rumored that Mlle. Nilsson was going to play a water scene, he wanted Madame Carvalho to go to the bottom of a pool to find the fatal bell.", "Finally, we gave up the idea of Mme. Carvalho's co\u00f6peration. The part of H\u00e9l\u00e8ne was given to beautiful Mlle. Schroeder and the rehearsals began. They were interrupted by the failure of the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Lyrique.", "Shortly afterwards Perrin asked for _Le Timbre d'Argent_ for the Op\u00e9ra. The adaptation of the work for the large stage at the Op\u00e9ra necessitated important modifications. The whole of the dialogue had to be set to music and the authors went to work on it. Perrin gave us Madame Carvalho for H\u00e9l\u00e8ne and Faure for Spiridion, but he wanted to burlesque the part for the tenor and give it to Mlle. Wertheimber. He wanted to engage her and had no other part for her. This was impossible. After several discussions Perrin yielded to the obstinate refusals of the authors, but I saw clearly from his attitude that he would never play our work.", "About that time du Locle took over the management of the Op\u00e9ra-Comique. He saw that Perrin, who was his uncle, had decided not to stage _Le Timbre d'Argent_ and asked me for it.", "This meant another metamorphosis for the work and new and considerable work for the musician. And this work was by no means easy. Until this time Barbier and Carr\u00e9 had been as close friends as Orestes and Pylades, but now they had a falling out. What one proposed, the other systematically refused. One lived in Paris; the other in the country. I went from Paris to the country and from the country to Paris trying to get these warring brothers to agree. This going to and fro lasted all summer, and then the temporary enemies came to an understanding and became as friendly as ever.", "We seemed to be nearly at the end of our troubles. Du Locle had found a wonderful dancer in Italy on whom we depended, but the dancer turned out not to be one at all. She was a _mime_, and did not dance.", "As there was no time to look for another dancer that season du Locle, to keep me patient, had me write with Louis Gallet _La Princesse Jaune_, with which I made my debut on the stage. I was thirty-five! This harmless little work was received with the fiercest hostility. \"It is impossible to tell,\" wrote Jouvin, a much feared critic of the time, \"in what key or in what time the overture is written.\" And to show me how utterly wrong I was, he told me that the public was \"a compound of angles and shadows.\" His prose was certainly more obscure than my music.", "Finally, a real dancer was engaged in Italy. It seemed as though nothing more could prevent the appearance of the unfortunate _Timbre_. \"I can't believe it,\" I said. \"Some catastrophe will put us off again.\"", "When that frightful crisis was at an end, the dancer was re-engaged. The parts were read to the artists, and the next day Am\u00e9d\u00e9 Achard threw up his r\u00f4le, declaring that it belonged to grand opera and was beyond the powers of an op\u00e9ra-comique tenor. It is well known that he ended his career at the Op\u00e9ra.", "Another tenor had to be found, but tenors are rare birds and we were unable to get one. To use the dancer he had engaged du Locle had Gallet and Guiraud improvise a short act, _Le Kobold_, which met with great success. The dancer was exquisite. Then du Locle lost interest in _Le Timbre d'Argent_ and then came the failure of the Op\u00e9ra-Comique.", "During all these tribulations I was preparing _Samson_, although I could find no one who even wanted to hear me speak of it. They all thought that I must be mad to attempt a Biblical subject. I gave a hearing of the second act at my house, but no one understood it at all. Without the aid of Liszt, who did not know a note of it, but who engaged me to finish it and put it on at Weimar, _Samson_. would never have seen the light. Afterwards it was refused in succession by Halanzier, Vaucorbeil, and Ritt and Gailhard, who decided to take it only after they had heard it sung by that admirable singer Rosine Bloch.", "But to return to _Le Timbre d'Argent_. I was again on the street with my score under my arm. About that time Vizentini revived the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Lyrique. His first play was _Paul et Virginie_, a wonderful success, and he was preparing for the close of the season another work which he liked. They were kindly disposed to me at the Ministry of Fine Arts and they interested themselves in my misfortunes. So they gave the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Lyrique a small subsidy on condition that they play my work. I came to the theatre as one who has meddled and I quickly recognized the discomforts of my position. First, there was a search for a singer; then, for a tenor, and they tried several without success. I found a tenor who, according to all reports, was of the first rank, but, after several days of negotiation, the matter was dropped. I learned later from the artist that the manager intended to engage him for only four performances, evidently planning that the work should be played only four times.", "The choice finally fell on Blum. He had a fine voice, and was a perfect singer but no actor. Indeed he said he didn't want to be an actor; his ideal was to appear in white gloves. Each day brought new bickerings. They made cuts despite my wishes; they left me at the mercy of the insubordination and rudeness of the stage manager and the ballet master, who would not listen to my most modest suggestions. I had to pay the cost of extra musicians in the wings myself. Some stage settings which I wanted for the prologue were declared impossible--I have seen them since in the _Tales of Hoffman_.", "Furthermore, the orchestra was very ordinary. There had to be numerous rehearsals which they did not refuse me, but they took advantage of them to spread the report that my music was unplayable. A young journalist who is still alive (I will not name him) wrote two advance notices which were intended to pave the way for the failure of my work.", "At the last moment the director saw that he had been on the wrong tack and that he might have a success. As they had played fairyland in the theatre in the Square des-Arts-et-M\u00e9tiers, he had at hand all the needed material to give me a luxurious stage-setting without great expense. Mlle. Caroline Salla was given the part of H\u00e9l\u00e8ne. With her beauty and magnificent voice she was certainly remarkable. But the passages which had been written for the light high soprano of Madame Carvalho were poorly adapted for a dramatic soprano. They concluded, therefore, that I didn't know how to write vocal music.", "In spite of everything the work was markedly successful, the natural result of a splendid performance in which two stars--Melchissedech and Mlle. Adeline Th\u00e9odore, at present teacher of dancing at the Op\u00e9ra--shone.", "Poor Vizentini! His opinion of me has changed greatly since that time. We were made to understand and love each other, so he has become, with years, one of my best and most devoted friends. He first produced my ballet _Javotte_ at the Grand-Th\u00e9\u00e2tre in Lyons, which the Monnaie in Brussels had ordered and then refused. He had dreams of directing the Op\u00e9ra-Comique and installing _Le Timbre d'Argent_ there. Fate willed otherwise.", "We have seen how the young French school was encouraged under the Empire. The situation has improved and the old state of affairs has never returned. But we find more than the analogy between the old point of view and the one that was revealed not long ago when the French musicians complained that they were more or less sacrificed in favor of their foreign contemporaries. At bottom it is the same spirit in a modified form.", "To resume. As everyone knows, the way to become a blacksmith is by working at a forge. Sitting in the shade does not give the experience which develops talent. We should never have known the great days of the Italian theatre, if Rossini, Donizetti, Bellini, and Verdi had had to undergo our r\u00e9gime. If Mozart had had to wait until he was forty to produce his first opera, we should never have had _Don Giovanni_ or _Le Nozze di Figaro_, for Mozart died at thirty-five.", "The policy imposed on Bizet and Delibes certainly deprived us of several works which would now be among the glories of the repertoire at the Op\u00e9ra and the Op\u00e9ra-Comique. That is an irreparable misfortune; one which we cannot sufficiently deplore.", "As _D\u00e9janire_, cast in a new form, has again appeared in the vast frame of the Op\u00e9ra stage, I may be allowed to recall my recollections of my friend and collaborator, Louis Gallet, the diligent and chosen companion of my best years, whose support was so dear and precious to me. Collaboration for some reason unknown to me is deprecated. Opera, it is said, should spring from the brain like Minerva, fully armed. So much the better if such divine intellects can be found, but they are rare and always will be. For dramatic and literary art on the one hand and musical art on the other require different powers, which are not ordinarily found in the same person.", "I first met Louis Gallet in 1871. Camille du Locle, who was the manager of the Op\u00e9ra-Comique at the time, could not put on _Le Timbre d'Argent_, and while he waited for better days, which never came, to do that, he offered me a one-act work. He proposed Louis Gallet as my collaborator, although I had not known him until then. \"You were made to understand each other,\" he told me. Gallet was then employed in some capacity at the Beaujon hospital and lived near me in the Faubourg Saint-Honor\u00e9. We soon formed the habit of seeing each other every day. Du Locle had judged aright. We had the same tastes in art and literature. We were equally averse to whatever is too theatrical and also to whatever is not sufficiently so, to the commonplace and the too extravagant. We both despised easy success and we understood each other wonderfully. Gallet was not a musician, but he enjoyed and understood music, and he criticised with rare good taste.", "Japan had recently been opened to Europeans. Japan was fashionable; all they talked about was Japan, it was a real craze. So the idea of writing a Japanese piece occurred to us. We submitted the idea to du Locle, but he was afraid of an entirely Japanese stage setting. He wanted us to soften the Japanese part, and it was he, I think, who had the idea of making it half Japanese and half Dutch, the way the slight work _La Princesse Jaune_ was cast.", "That was only a beginning and in our daily talks we sketched the most audacious projects. The leading concerts of the time did not balk at performing large vocal works, as they too often do to-day to the great detriment of the variety of their programmes. We then thought that we were at the beginning of the prosperity of French oratorio which only needed encouragement to flourish. I read by chance in an old Bible this wonderful phrase,", "\"And it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth,\" and so I proposed to Gallet that we do a Deluge. At first he wanted to introduce characters. \"No,\" I said, \"put the Bible narrative into simple verse, and I will do the rest.\" We know with what care and success he accomplished his delicate task. Meanwhile he gave Massenet the texts for _Marie-Madeleine_ and _Le Roi de Lahore_, and these two works created a great stir in the operatic world.", "We had dreams of historical opera, for we were quite without the prejudice against this form of drama which afflicts the present school. But I was not _persona grata_ to the managers and I did not know at what door to knock, when one of my friends, Aim\u00e9 Gros, took the management of the Grand-Th\u00e9\u00e2tre at Lyons and asked me for a work. This was a fine opportunity and we grasped it. We put together, with difficulty but with infinite zest, our historical opera, _Etienne Marcel_, in which Louis Gallet endeavored to respect as far as is possible in a theatrical work the facts of history. Despite illustrious examples to the contrary he did not believe that it was legitimate to attribute to a character who has actually lived acts and opinions that are entirely fanciful. I was in full agreement with him in that as in so many other things. I go even farther and cannot accustom myself to the queer sauces in which legendary characters are often served. It seems to me that the legend is the interesting thing, and not the character, and that the latter loses all its value when the legend which surrounds it is destroyed. But everyone knows that I am a crank.", "Some time after my _Henri VIII_, in which Vaucorbeil had imposed another collaborator on me, Ritt asked me for a new work. We were looking about for a subject, when Gallet came to my house and timidly, as if fearing a rebuff, proposed _Benvenuto Cellini_. I had thought of that for a long time, and the idea had come to me of putting into musical form that fine drama, which had had its hours of glory, where M\u00e9lingue modeled the statue of Hebe before the populace. I, therefore, accepted the suggestion with pleasure. This enterprise brought me in touch with Paul Meurice, whom I had known in my childhood, when he was wooing Mlle. Granger, his first wife and an intimate friend of my mother's. Paul Meurice revealed a secret to me: that the romance _Ascanio_, attributed to Alexander Dumas, had been entirely written by Meurice. The work met with a great success, and out of gratitude, Dumas offered to help Meurice in constructing a drama from the romance, which was to be signed by Meurice alone. So it is easy for one who knows Dumas's dramas to find traces of his handiwork in _Benvenuto Cellini_.", "It was not particularly easy to make an opera out of the play, and Gallet and I worked together at it with considerable difficulty. We soon saw that we should have to eliminate the famous scene of the casting of the statue. When we reached this point in the play, Benvenuto had already done a good deal of singing, and this scene with its violence seemed certain to exceed the strength of the most valiant artist. In connection with our _Proserpine_, I have been accused of supposing that Vacquerie had genius. It would be too much to say that he had genius, but he certainly had great talent. His prose showed a classical refinement, and his poetry, in spite of fantastic passages which no one could admire, was sonorous in tone, contained precious material, and was both interesting and highly individual. What allured me in _Proserpine_ was the amount of inner emotion there was in the drama, which is very advantageous to the music. Music gives expression to feelings which the characters cannot express, and accentuates and develops the picturesqueness of the piece; it makes acceptable what would not even exist without it.", "Vacquerie approved highly the convent scene which Gallet invented. This introduced a quiet and peaceful note amidst the violence of the original work. Gallet wrote a sonnet in Alexandrine verse for Sabatino's declaration of his love. I was unable to set this to music, for the twelve feet embarrassed me and prevented my getting into my stride. As I did not know what else to do, I took the sonnet and by main force reduced the verse to ten feet with a c\u00e6sura at the fifth foot. I took this to my dear collaborator in fear and trembling, and, as I had feared, he at once fell into the depths of despair.", "\"That was the best thing in my work,\" he said. \"I nursed and caressed that sonnet, and now you have ruined it.\"", "In the face of this despair, I screwed up my courage. As I had previously cut down the verse, I now tried lengthening out the music. Then, I sang both versions to the disconsolate poet.", "And what a miracle! He was altogether reconciled, approved both versions, and did not know which one to choose. We ended with a patchwork. The two quatrains are in verses of ten feet, and the two tiercets in Alexandrine metre.", "Outside of our work, too, our relations were delightful. We wrote to each other constantly in both prose and verse; we bombarded each other with sonnets; his letters were sometimes ornamented with water colors, for he drew very well and one of his joys was to cover white paper with color. Gallet drew the sketches for the desert in _Le Roi de Lahore_ and the cloister in _Proserpine_.", "When Madame Adam founded the _Nouvelle Revue_ she offered me the position of musical critic, which I did not think I ought to accept. She did not know where to turn. \"Take Gallet,\" I advised her. \"He is an accomplished man of letters. He is not a musician in the sense that he has studied music, but he has the soul of a musician, which is worth much more.\" Madame Adam followed my advice and found it good.", "At this period, under the guise of Wagnerism, the wildest theories and the most extravagant assertions were current in musical criticism. Gallet was naturally well poised and independent and he did not do as the rest did. Instead he opposed them, but from unwillingness to give needless offense he displayed marked tact and discretion in his criticisms. This did him no good, however, for it aroused no sentiment of gratitude, and without giving him credit for a literary style that was rare among librettists, his contemporaries received each of his works with a hostility entirely devoid of either justice or mercy. Gallet felt this hostility keenly. He felt that he did not deserve it, since he took so much care in his work and put so much courtesy into his criticism. The blank verse he used in _Tha\u00efs_ with admirable regard for color and harmony, counting on the music to take the place of the rhyme, was not appreciated. This verse was free from assonance and the banalities which it draws into operatic works, but it kept the rhythm and sonorous sound which is far removed from prose. That was the period when there was nothing but praise for Alfred Ernst's gibberish, though that was an insult alike to the French language and the masterpieces he had the temerity to translate. Gallet used the same blank verse in _D\u00e9janire_, although its use here was more debatable, but he handled it with surprising skill. Now that this text has been set to music, it shows its full beauty.", "Louis Gallet devoted a large part of his time to administrative duties, for he was successively treasurer and manager of hospitals. Nevertheless he produced works in abundance. He left a record of no less than forty operatic librettos, plays, romances, memoirs, pamphlets, and innumerable articles. I wish I knew what to say about the man himself, his unwearying goodness, his loyalty, his scrupulousness, his good humor, his originality, his continual common sense, and his intellect, alert to everything unusual and interesting.", "What good talks we used to have as we dined under an arbor in the large garden which was his delight at Lariboisi\u00e8re! I used to take him seeds, and he made amusing botanical experiments with them.", "He was seriously ill at one period of his life. He was wonderfully nursed by his wife--who was a saint--and he endured prolonged and atrocious sufferings with the patience of a saint. He watched the growth of his fatal disease with a stoicism worthy of the sages of antiquity and he had no illusion about the implacable illness which slowly but surely would result in his premature death. A constantly increasing deafness was his greatest trouble. This cruel infirmity had made frightful progress when, in 1899, the Ar\u00e8nes de B\u00e9ziers opened its doors for the second time to _D\u00e9janire_. In spite of everything, including his ill health which made the trip very painful, he wanted to see his work once more. He heard nothing, however--neither the artists, the choruses, nor even the applause of the several thousand spectators who encored it enthusiastically. A little later he passed on, leaving in his friends' hearts and at the work-tables of his collaborators a void which it is impossible to fill.", "Oceans of ink have been spilled in discussing the question of whether the subjects of operas should be taken from history or mythology, and the question is still a mooted one. To my mind it would have been better if the question had never been raised, for it is of little consequence what the answer is. The only things worth while are whether the music is good and the work interesting. But _Tannhauser_, _Lohengrin_, _Tristan_ and _Siegfried_ appeared and the question sprang up. The heroes of mythology, we are told, are invested with a prestige which historical characters can never have. Their deeds lose significance and in their place we have their feelings, their emotions, to the great benefit of the operas. After these works, however, _Hans Sachs_ (Die Meistersinger) appeared, and although he is not mythical at all he is a fine figure nevertheless. But in this case the plot is of little account, for the interest lies mainly in the emotions--the only thing, it appears, which music with its divine language ought to express.", "It is true that music makes it possible to simplify dramatic action and it gives a chance, as well, for the free expression and play of sentiments, emotions and passions. In addition, music makes possible pantomimic scenes which could not be done otherwise, and the music itself flows more easily under such conditions. But that does not mean that such conditions are indispensable for music. Music in its flexibility and adaptability offers inexhaustible resources. Give Mozart a fairy tale like the _Magic Flute_ or a lively comedy such as _Le Nozze di Figaro_ and he creates without effort an immortal masterpiece.", "It is a question whether there is any essential difference between history and mythology. History is made up of what probably happened; mythology of what probably did not happen. There are myths in history and history in myths. Mythology is merely the old form of history. Every myth is rooted in truth. And we have to seek for this truth in the fable, just as we try to reconstruct extinct animals from the remains Time has preserved to us. Behind the story of Prometheus we see the invention of fire; behind the loves of Ceres and Triptolemus the invention of the plow and the beginnings of agriculture. The adventures of the Argonauts show us the first attempts at voyages of exploration and the discovery of gold mines. Volumes have been written about the truths behind the fables, and explanations have been found for the strangest facts of mythology, even for the metamorphoses which Ovid described so poetically.", "Halfway between history and mythology come the sacred writings. Each race has its own. Ours are the Old and New Testament. Many believe that these books are myths; a larger number--the Believers--that they are history, Sacred History, the only true history--the only one about which it is not permitted to express a doubt. If you want a proof of this, recall that not so many years ago a clergyman in the Church of England was censured by his ecclesiastical superiors for daring to say in a sermon that the Serpent in the Garden of Eden was symbolical and not a real creature.", "And the ecclesiastical authorities were right. The basis of Christianity is the Redemption--the incarnation and sacrifice of God himself to blot out the stain of the first great sin and also to open the Kingdom of Heaven to men. That original sin was Adam's fall, when he followed the example of Eve, a victim of the Serpent's treacherous counsels, and disobeyed the command not to taste the Forbidden Fruit. Eliminate the Garden of Eden, the Serpent, the Forbidden Fruit, and the entire fabric of Christianity crumbles.", "If we turn to profane history and take any historical work, we find that the facts are told in such a way that they seem to us beyond dispute. But if we see the same facts from the pen of another historian, we no longer recognize them. The reason is that a writer almost never undertakes the task of wrestling with the giant, History, unless he is impelled to do so by a preconceived idea, by a general conception, or a system he wants to establish. And whether he wants to or not, he sees the facts in a light favorable to his preconceived idea, and observes them through prisms which increase or diminish their importance at his will. Then, however great his discernment and however strong his desire to reach the truth, it is doubtful if he ever will. In history, as elsewhere, absolute truth escapes mankind. Louis XIV, Louis XV, Madame de Maintenon, Madame de Pompadour, Louis XVI, even Napoleon and Josephine, so near our own times, are already quasi-mythical characters. The Louis XIII of _Marion de Lorme_ seemed until very lately to be accurate, but recent discoveries show us that he was quite different.", "Napoleon III reigned only yesterday, but his picture is already painted in different tints. My entire youth was passed in his reign and my recollections represent him neither as the monster depicted by Victor Hugo nor the kind sympathetic sovereign of present-day stories.", "There has been a great deal of discussion of the causes which brought on the War of 1870. We know all that was said and done during the last days of that crisis, but will anyone ever know what was hidden in the minds of the sovereigns, the ministers, and the ambassadors? Will it ever be known whether the Emperor provoked Gramont or Gramont the Emperor? Did they even know themselves? There is one thing the most discerning historian can never reach--the depths of the human soul.", "We may, however, learn the secrets of the tomb. It was asserted for a long time that the remains of Voltaire and Rousseau had been exhumed, desecrated, and thrown into the sewers. Victor Hugo wrote a wonderful account of this--an account such as only he could write. One fine day doubt about this occurrence popped up unexpectedly. After waiting a long time it was decided to get to the heart of the matter, and they finally opened the coffins of the two great men. They were peacefully sleeping their last sleep. The deed never took place; its history was a myth.", "In this connection Victor Hugo's credulity may be mentioned, for it was astonishing in a man of such colossal genius. He believed in the most incredible things, as the \"Man in the Iron Mask,\" the twin brother of Louis XIV; in the octopus that has no mouth and feeds itself through its arms; and in the reality of the Japanese sirens which the Japanese were said to make out of an ape and a fish. He had some excuse for the sirens as the Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences believed in them for a short time.", "If what is called history is so near mythology as, many times, to be confounded with it, what about romance and the historical drama in which events, entirely imaginative, must of necessity find a place? What about the long-drawn-out conversations in books and on the stage that are attributed to historical persons? What about the actions attributed to them, which need not be true but only seem to be so? The supernatural element is the only thing lacking to make such works mythological in every way.", "Now the supernatural lends itself admirably to expression in music and music finds in the supernatural a wealth of resources. But these resources are by no means indispensable. What music must have above all are emotions and passions laid bare and set in action by what we term the situation. And where can one find more or better situations than in history?", "From the time of Lulli until the end of the Eighteenth Century French opera was legendary, that is to say, it was mythological in character and was not, as has been pretended, limited to the depiction of emotion and the inner feelings in order to avoid contingencies. The real motive was to find in fables material for a spectacle. Tragedy, as we know, does not do this, for it can be developed only with considerable difficulty when the stage is crowded with actors. On the contrary, opera, which is free in its movements and can fill a vast stage, seeks for pomp, display and haloes in which gods and goddesses appear, in fact all that can be put into a stage-setting. If they did not use local color, it was because local color had not been invented. Finally, as we all get tired of everything, so they tired of mythology. Then the historical work was adopted and appeared on the stage with success, as is well known. The historical method had no rival until _Robert le Diable_ rather timidly brought back the legendary element which triumphed later in the work of Richard Wagner.", "In the meantime _Les Huguenots_ succeeded _Robert le Diable_ and for half a century this was the bright particular star of historical opera. Even now, although its traditions have largely been forgotten and although its workmanship is rather inferior to that of a later time, this memorable work nevertheless shines, like the setting sun, surprisingly brilliantly. The several generations who admired this work were not altogether wrong. There is no necessity to class this brilliant success as a failure, because Robert Schumann, who knew nothing about the stage, denied its worth. It is surprising that Berlioz's judgment has not been set against Schumann's. Berlioz showed his enthusiasm for _Les Huguenots_ in his famous treatise on instrumentation.", "The great public is little interested in technical polemics and is faithful to the old successes. Although little by little success has come to operas based on legends, there still remains a taste for operas with a historical background. This is not without a reason for as an authoritative critic has said: \"A historical drama may contain lyric possibilities far greater than most of the poor, weak mythological librettos on which composers waste their strength, fully persuaded that by doing so they cause 'the holy spirit of Bayreuth to descend upon them.'\"", "And they never would have dreamed of being mythological, if their god, instead of turning to Scandinavian mythology, had followed his original intention of dramatizing the exploits of Frederick Barbarossa. In his youth he was not opposed to historical opera, for he eulogized _La Musette de Portici_, _La Juive_, and _La Reine de Chypre_. He made some justifiable criticisms of the libretto of the last work, although he admitted that the composer had contrived to write beautiful passages.", "\"We cannot praise Hal\u00e9vy too highly,\" he wrote, \"for the firmness with which he resists every temptation, to which many of his contemporaries succumb, to steal easy applause by relying blindly on the talent of the singers. On the contrary, he demands that his _virtuosi_, even the most famous of them, shall subordinate themselves to the lofty inspiration of his Muse. He attains this result by the simplicity and truth he knows how to stamp on dramatic melodies.\"", "Fortunately we no longer demand that operas be mythological, for if we did we should have to condemn the famous Russian operas and that is out of the question. However, the method of treatment is still in dispute and this question is involved. One method of treatment is admitted and another is not and it is extremely difficult to tell what is what.", "I am now going to do a little special pleading for my _Henri VIII_, which, it would seem, is not in the proper manner. Not that I want to defend the music or to protest against the criticisms it has inspired, for that is not done. But I may, perhaps, be permitted to speak of the piece itself and to tell how the music was adapted to it.", "According to the critics it would seem that the whole of _Henri VIII_ is superficial and without depth, _en fa\u00e7ade_; that the souls of the characters are not revealed, and that the King, at first all sugary sweetness, suddenly becomes a monster without any preparation for, or explanation of, the change.", "In this connection let us consider _Boris Godounof_, for there is a historical drama suited to its music. I saw _Boris Godounof_ with considerable interest. I heard pleasant and impressive passages, and others less so. In one scene I saw an insignificant friar who suddenly becomes the Emperor in the next scene. One entire act is made up of processions, the ringing of bells, popular songs, and dazzling costumes. In another scene a nurse tells pretty stories to the children in her charge. Then there is a love duet, which is neither introduced nor has any relationship to the development of the work; an incomprehensible evening entertainment, and, finally, funeral scenes in which Chaliapine was admirable. It was not my fault if I did not discover in all that the inner life, the psychology, the introductions, and the explanations which they complain they do not find in _Henri VIII_.", "\"To Henry VIII,\" it is stated at the beginning of the work, \"nothing is sacred, neither friendship, love nor his word--ill are playthings of his mad whims. He knows neither law nor justice.\" And when, a little later, smiling, the King hands the holy water to the ambassador he is receiving, the orchestra reveals the working of his mind by repeating the music of the preceding scene. From beginning to end the work is written in this way. But dissertations on such details have not been given the public; the themes of felony, cruelty, and duplicity, and of this and that, have not, as is the fashion of the day, been underlined, so that the critics are excusable for not seeing them.", "Not a scene, not a word, they say, shows the soul of Henry VIII. I would like to ask if it is not revealed in the great scene between Henry and Catharine, where he plays with her as a cat with a mouse, where he veils his desire to be rid of her under his religious scruples, and where he heaps on her constantly vile and cruel insinuations, or even in the last scene with its cruel hypocrisies. It is difficult to see why all his passions and all his feelings are not brought into play here. The Russian librettos do no more, nor the operas based on mythology.", "But to continue. From the point of view of opera mythology offers one advantage in the use of the miraculous. But the rest of the mythical element offers, rather, difficulties. Characters who never existed and in whom no one believes cannot be made interesting in themselves. They do not sustain, as is sometimes supposed, the music and poetry. On the contrary, the music and poetry give them such reality as they possess. We could not endure the interminable utterances of the mournful Wotan, if it were not for the wonderful music that accompanies them. Orpheus weeping over Eurydice would not move us greatly, if Gluck had not known how to captivate us by his first notes. If it were not for Mozart's music, the puppets of the _Magic Flute_ would amount to nothing.", "Musicians should, as a matter of fact, be allowed to choose both the subject and motives for their operas according to their temperaments and their feelings. Much youthful talent is lost to-day because the young composers believe that they must obey set rules instead of obeying their own inspiration. All great artists, the illustrious Richard more than any other, mocked the critics.", "As I have spoken of Richard Wagner's youth, I will take advantage of the opportunity to reveal a secret of one of his own works which is known to me alone. When Wagner was young, I was a child and I attended constantly the sessions of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Concerts. The kettledrummer of that day had a peculiar habit of breaking in before the rest of the orchestra. When the others began, it produced an effect which the authors had hardly foreseen and which was certain to be condemned. But the effect had a rather distinctive character and I thought it might be possible to use it. Richard Wagner lived in Paris at the time and frequented the famous concerts. There is no doubt that he noted this effect and used it in his overture to _Faust_.", "Art is a mystery--something which responds to a special sense, peculiar to the human race. This is ordinarily called the esthetic sense, but that is an inexact term, for esthetic sense signifies a sense of the beautiful and what is esthetic is not necessarily beautiful. Sense of style would be better.", "Some of the savage races have this sense of style, for their arms and utensils show a remarkable feeling for style, which they lose by contact with civilization.", "By art let us understand, if you please, the Fine Arts alone, but including decorative art. Music ought to be included.", "I shall astonish most of my readers, when I say that very few people understand music. For most people it is, as Victor Hugo said, an exhalation of art--something for the ear as perfume is for the olfactory sense, a source of vague sensations, necessarily unformed as all sensations are. But musical art is something entirely different. It has line, modeling, color through instrumentation, all making up an ideal sphere where some, like the writer of these lines, live from childhood on, which others attain through education, while many others never know it at all. Furthermore, musical art has more movement than the other fine arts. It is the most mysterious of them all, although the others are mysterious as it is easy to see.", "The first manifestation of art occurs through attempts to reproduce objects. Such attempts have been found which date back to prehistoric times. But what is primitive man's idea in such attempts? He wants to record by a line the contour of the object, the likeness of which he wishes to preserve. This contour and this line do not exist in nature. The whole philosophy of art is in that crude drawing. It bases itself on nature even while making something quite different in response to a special, inexplicable need of the human spirit. Accordingly nothing can be more chimerical or vain than the advice so often given to the artist to be truthful. Art can never be true, even though it should not be false. It should be true artistically, by giving an artistic translation which will satisfy the sense of style of which we have spoken. When Art has satisfied this sense of style, the object of artistic expression has been attained; nothing more can be asked. But it is not the \"vain effort of an unproductive cleverness,\" as our M. de Mun has said; it is an effort to satisfy a legitimate need, one of the loftiest and most honorable in human nature--the need of art.", "If this is so, why should we demand that Art be useful or moral? It is both in its own way, for it awakens noble and honest sentiments in the soul. That was the opinion of Th\u00e9ophile Gautier, but Victor Hugo disagreed. The sun is beautiful, he used to say, and it is useful. That is true, but the sun is not an object of art. Besides, how many times Victor Hugo denied his own doctrine by writing verses which were merely brilliant descriptions or admirable bits of imagination?", "We are, however, talking of art and not of literature. Literature becomes art in poetry but forsakes it in prose. Even if some of the great prose writers rendered their prose artistic through the beauty and harmony of their periods and the picturesqueness of their expressions, still prose is not art in its real nature. So, crude indecency aside, what would be immoral in prose ceases to be immoral in verse, for in poetry Art follows its own code and form transcends the subject matter. That is why a great poet, Sully-Prudhomme, preferred prose to verse when he wanted to write philosophically, for he feared, on account of the superiority of form to substance in poetry, that his ideas would not be taken seriously. That explains as well why parents take young girls to hear an opera, when if the same piece was played without music they would be appalled at the idea. What Christian is ever shocked by _La Juive_ or Catholic frightened away from _Les Huguenots_?", "Because prose is far removed from art, it is unsuited to music, despite the fact that this ill-assorted union is fashionable to-day? In poetry there has been an effort to make it so artistic that form alone is considered and verse is written which is entirely without sense. But that is a fad which can't last long.", "\"Not to take sides is what the author is inhibited from doing. Art, to my way of thinking, is a setting forth of ideas. If it is not that--if it limits itself solely to considerations of form, to a worship of beauty for its own sake, without regard to the deeds and thoughts it brings to light, then it seems to me no better than the vain effort of an unproductive cleverness.\"", "The eminent speaker is absolutely right as far as prose is concerned, but we cannot agree with him if poetry is considered.", "Victor Hugo, in his marvellous ode, _La Lyre et La Harpe_ brings Paganism and Christianity face to face. Each speaks in turn, and the poet in his last stanza seems to acknowledge that both are right, but that does not prevent the ode from being a masterpiece. That would not be possible in prose, but in the poem the poetry carries all before it.", "Why is it that geniuses like Victor Hugo, distinguished minds, thinkers, and profound critics, refuse to see that Art is a special entity which responds to a certain sense? If Art accommodates itself marvellously, if it accords itself with the precepts of morality and passion, it is nevertheless sufficient unto itself--and in its self-sufficiency lies its heights of greatness.", "The first prelude of Sebastian Bach's _Wohltemperirte Klavier_ expresses nothing, and yet that is one of the marvels of music. The Venus de Milo expresses nothing, and it is one of the marvels of sculpture.", "To tell the truth, it is proper to add that in order not to be immoral Art must appeal to those who have a feeling for it. Where the artist sees only beautiful forms, the gross see only nudity. I have seen a good man scandalized at the sight of Ingres's _La Source_.", "Just as morality has no function to be artistic, so Art has nothing to do with morality. Both have their own functions, and each is useful in its own way. The final aim of morality is morality; of art, art, and nothing else.", "Ren\u00e9 Bazin has sketched cleverly Pasteur's brilliant career. France has no clearer claim to glory than in Pasteur, for he is one of the men, who, in spite of everything, keeps her in the first rank of nations.", "A rare good fortune attended him. While many scholars who seek the truth without concerning themselves with the practical results have to wait many long years before their discoveries can be used, Pasteur's discoveries were useful at once. So the mob, which cannot understand science studied for its own sake, appreciated Pasteur's works. He saved millions to the public treasury, and tens of thousands of human lives.", "He had already secured a notable place in science when the public learned his name through the memorable contest between him and Pouchet over \"spontaneous generation.\" The probabilities of the case were on Pouchet's side. People refused to believe that these organisms which developed in great numbers in an enclosed jar or that the molds which developed under certain conditions were not produced spontaneously. The youth of the time went wild over the question.", "I was constantly being asked, \"Are you for Pouchet or Pasteur?\" and my invariable response was, \"I shall be for the one who proves he is right.\" I was unwilling to admit that any such question could be solved _a priori_ in accordance with preconceived ideas, although I must confess that among my friends I found no one of the same opinion.", "We know how Pasteur won a striking victory through his patience and his genius. He demonstrated that millions and millions of germs are present in the air about us and that when one of them finds favorable conditions, a living being appears which engenders others. \"Many are called, but few are chosen.\" This law may seem unjust, but it is one of the great laws of Nature.", "Pasteur, the great benefactor, whose discoveries did so much for all classes of society, should have been popular, but he was, on the contrary, extremely unpopular. The leading publicists of the day were influenced by some inexplicable sentiment and they made constant war on him. When, after several years of prodigious labor, Pasteur ventured to assert himself, they took advantage of his following the dictates of humanity in accepting all sorts of cases, curable or not, to spread a report that his treatment did not cure, but instead gave the disease which it was supposed to cure. Popular fury was aroused to such a height, that a monster mass meeting was held _against_ Pasteur. Louise Michel addressed this meeting with her customary vigor of speech and amidst frantic applause shouted this unqualified remark, \"_Scientific questions should be settled by the people._\"", "By this time everybody was talking about microbes, and a shop on the boulevards announced an exhibition of them. They used what is known as a solar microscope and threw on a screen, suitably enlarged, the animalculae which grow in impure water, the larvae of mosquitoes, and other insects, which bear about the same relation to microbes that an elephant does to a flea. I went into this establishment, and saw the plain people with their wives looking at the exhibition very seriously and really believing that they saw the famous microbes. One of them near me said, with a knowing air, \"What won't science do next?\"", "I was indignant, and I had all I could do to keep from saying: \"They are fooling you. What they are showing you is not Science, at the most only its antechamber. As for you who are deceiving these na\u00efve good people, you are only impostors.\"", "But I kept still; I would only have succeeded in getting thrown out. But I said to myself--and I still say--\"Why not enlighten these people, who obviously want light?\" It is impossible to _teach_ them science, but it should be possible to make them at least comprehend what science _is_, for they have no idea of it now. They do not know--in this era when they are constantly talking about their rights and urged to demand more wages and less work--that there are young people who are spending their best years and leading a precarious existence, working day and night, without hope of personal profit, with no other end in view besides the hope of discovering new facts from which humanity may benefit at some time in the future. They do not know that all the benefits of civilization which they carelessly enjoy are the result of the long, painful and enormous work of the thinkers whom they regard as idlers and visionaries who grow rich from the sweat of the toilers. In a word, they should be taught to give respect to what is worthy of it.", "It is true that there are scientific congresses, but these are serious gatherings which attract only the select few. It should be possible to interest everybody, and in order to make scientific meetings interesting we should use motion pictures and concerts.", "But here we trench on art. We ought to teach the people not only science but art as well, but the latter is the more difficult.", "Modern peoples are not artistic. The Greeks were, and the Japanese were, before the European invasion. An artistic people is recognized by their ignorance of \"objects of art,\" for in such an environment art is everywhere. An artistic people no more dreams of creating art than a great nobleman of consciously exhibiting a distinguished manner. Distinction lies in his slightest mannerism without his being conscious of the fact. So, among artistic peoples, the most ordinary and humble objects have style. And this style, furthermore, is in perfect harmony with the purpose of the object. It is absolutely appropriate for that purpose in its proportions, in the purity of its lines, the elegance of its form, its perfection of execution, and, above all, in its meaning. When an outcry is raised against the ugliness and tawdriness of certain objects in this country, the answer is, \"But see how cheap they are!\" But style and conscience in work cost nothing. Feeling for art is, however, inherent in human nature. The weapons of primitive peoples are beautiful. The prehistoric hatchets of the Stone Age are perfect in their contours. There is, therefore, no question of creating a feeling for art in the people, but of awakening it.", "Music holds so important a place in the modern world, that we ought to begin with that. There is plenty of gay music, easy to understand, which is in harmony with the laws of art, and the people ought to hear it instead of the horrors which they cram into our ears under the pretence of satisfying our tastes. What pleases people most is sentimental music, but it need not be a silly sentimentality. Instead, they ought to give the people the charming airs which grow, as naturally as daisies on a lawn, in the vast field of op\u00e9ra-comique. That is not high art, it is true, but it is pretty music and it is high art compared with what is heard too often in the caf\u00e9s. I am not ignorant of the fact that such establishments employ talented people. But along with the good, what frightful things one hears! And no one would listen to their instrumental repertoire anywhere else!", "Every time anyone has tried to raise the standards and employ real singers and real _virtuosi_, the attendance has increased. But, very often, even at the theatres, the managers satisfy their own tastes under the pretence of satisfying that of the public. That is, of course, intensely human. We judge others by ourselves.", "A famous manager once said to me, as he pointed to an empty house, \"The public is amazing. Give them what they like, and they don't come!\"", "One day I was walking in a garden. There was a bandstand and musicians were playing some sort of music. The crowd was indifferent and passed by talking without paying the slightest attention. Suddenly there sounded the first notes of the delightful _andante_ of Beethoven's _Symphony in D_--a flower of spring with a delicate perfume. At the first notes all walking and talking stopped. And the crowd stood motionless and in an almost religious silence as it listened to the marvel. When the piece was over, I went out of the garden, and near the entrance I heard one of the managers say,", "Music is as old as human nature. We can get some idea of what it was at first from the music of savage tribes. There were a few notes and rudimentary melodies with blows struck in cadence as an accompaniment; or, sometimes, the same primitive rhythms without any accompaniment--and nothing else! Then melody was perfected and the rhythms became more complicated. Later came Greek music, of which we know little, and the music of the East and Far East.", "Music, as we now understand the term, began with the attempts at harmony in the Middle Ages. These attempts were labored and difficult, and the uncertainty of their gropings, combined with the slowness of their development, excites our wonder. Centuries were necessary before the writing of music became exact, but, slowly, laws were elaborated. Thanks to them the works of the Sixteenth Century came into being, in all their admirable purity and learned polyphony. Hard and inflexible laws engendered an art analogous to primitive painting. Melody was almost entirely absent and was relegated to dance tunes and popular songs. But the dance tunes of the time, on which, perhaps, erudition was not used sufficiently, were written in the same polyphonic style and with the same rigid correctness as the madrigals and the church music.", "We know that the popular songs found their way into the church music and that Palestrina's great reform consisted in banishing them. However, we should get but a feeble idea of the part they played, if we imagined that they naturally belonged there. Take a well known air, _Au Claire de la Lune_, for example, and make each note a whole note sung by the tenor, while the other voices dialogue back and forth in counterpoint, and see what is left of the song for the listener. The scandal of _La Messe de l'Homme arm\u00e9_ was entirely theoretical.", "We simply do not know how they played these anthems, masses, and madrigals, in the absence of any indication of either the time or the emphasis. We find a few directions for expression, as in the first measures of Palestrina's _Stabat Mater_ but such directions are extremely rare. They are simply the first signs of the dawn of the far-off day of music with expression. Certain learned and well-intentioned persons endeavor to compare this music with ours, and we surprise in some of the modern editions instances of _molto expressivo_ which seem to be good guesses. This exclusively consonant music, in which the intervals of fourths were considered dissonant, while the diminishing fifth was the _diabolus in musica_, ought from its very nature to be antithetical to expression. Nothing in the _Kyrie, in La Messe du Pape Marcel_, gives the impression of a prayer, unless expressive accents, without any real justification, are introduced by main strength.", "Expression came into existence with the chord of the dominant seventh from which all modern harmony developed. This invention is attributed to Monteverde. No matter what has been said, however, it occurs in Palestrina's _Adoremus_. Floods of ink have been poured out in discussing this question, some affirming, while others--and not the least, by any manner of means--denying the existence of the famous chord. No equivocation is possible. It is a simultaneously played chord held by four voices for a whole measure. What is certain is that Palestrina, by putting aside the rules, made a discovery, the significance of which he did not realize.", "With the introduction of the seventh interval a new era began. It would be a grave error to believe that the rules were overturned, for, instead, new principles were added to old ones as new conditions demanded. They learned how to modulate, how to transpose from one key to the next key and finally to the keys farthest away. In his treatise on harmony F\u00e9tis studied this evolution in a masterly manner. Unfortunately his scholarship was not combined with deep musical feeling. For example, he saw faults in Mozart and Beethoven where there are only beauties, and beauties which even an ignorant listener--if he is naturally musical--will see without trouble. He did not understand the vast difference between the unlettered person who commits a solecism and Pascal, the inventor of a new syntax.", "However that may be, F\u00e9tis gave us a comprehensive review in broad outlines of musical evolution down to what he justly called the \"omnitonic system,\" which Richard Wagner has achieved since. \"Beyond that,\" he said, \"I can see nothing more.\"", "He did not foresee the a-tonic system, but that is what we have come to. There is no longer any question of adding to the old rules new principles which are the natural expression of time and experience, but simply of casting aside all rules and every restraint.", "\"Everyone ought to make his own rules. Music is free and unlimited in its liberty of expression. There are no perfect chords, dissonant chords or false chords. All aggregations of notes are legitimate.\"", "He whose taste is developed by this system is not like the man who by tasting a wine can tell you its age and its vineyard, but he is rather like the fellow who with perfect indifference gulps down good or bad wine, brandy or whiskey, and prefers that which burns his gullet the most. The man who gets his work hung in the S\u00e2lon is not the one who puts on his canvas delicate touches in harmonious tones, but he who juxtaposes vermillion and Veronese green. The man with a \"developed taste\" is not the one who knows how to get new and unexpected results by passing from one key to another, as the great Richard did in _Die Meistersinger_, but rather the man who abandons all keys and piles up dissonances which he neither introduces nor concludes and who, as a result, grunts his way through music as a pig through a flower garden.", "Possibly they may go farther still. There seems to be no reason why they should linger on the way to untrammeled freedom or restrict themselves within a scale. The boundless empire of sound is at their disposal and let them profit by it. That is what dogs do when they bay at the moon, cats when they meow, and the birds when they sing. A German has written a book to prove that the birds sing false. Of course he is wrong for they do not sing false. If they did, their song would not sound agreeable to us. They sing outside of scales and it is delightful, but that is not man-made art.", "Some Spanish singers give a similar impression, through singing interminable grace notes beyond notation. Their art is intermediate between the singing of the birds and of man. It is not a higher art.", "In certain quarters they marvel at the progress made in the last thirty years. The architects of the Fifteenth Century must have reasoned in the same way. They did not appreciate that they were assassinating Gothic art, and that after some centuries we would have to revert to the art of the Greeks and Romans.", "When hairy Pan joined reeds of different lengths and so invented the flute which bears his name, he was, in reality, creating the organ. It needed only to add to this flute a keyboard and bellows to make one of those pretty instruments the first painters used to put in the hands of angels. As it developed and gradually became the most grandiose of the instruments, the organ, with its depth of tone modified and increased tenfold by the resonance of the great cathedrals, took on its religious character.", "The organ is more than a single instrument. It is an orchestra, a collection of the pipes of Pan of every size, from those as small as a child's playthings to those as gigantic as the columns of a temple. Each one corresponds to what is termed an organ-stop. The number is unlimited.", "The Romans made organs which must have been simple from the musical standpoint, though they were complicated in their mechanical construction. They were called hydraulic organs. The employment of water in a wind instrument has greatly perplexed the commentators. Cavaill\u00e9-Coll studied the question and solved the problem by demonstrating that the water compressed the air. This system was ingenious but imperfect, since it was applicable only to the most primitive instruments. The keys, it seems, were very large, and were struck by blows of the fist.", "Let us leave erudition for art and primitive for perfected instruments. By the time of Sebastian Bach and Rameau the organ had taken on its grandiose character. The stops had multiplied and the organist _called_ them by means of registers which he drew out or pushed back at will. In order to give greater resources, the builder multiplied the keyboards. Pedals were introduced to help out the keyboards. At that time Germany alone had pedals worthy of the name and worth while in playing an interesting bass part. In France and elsewhere the rudimentary pedals were only used for certain fundamental notes or in prolonged _tenutos_. No one outside of Germany could play Sebastian Bach's compositions.", "Playing on the old instruments was fatiguing and uncomfortable. The touch was heavy and, when one used both the pedals and the keyboards, a real display of strength was necessary. A similar display was necessary to draw out or push back the registers, some of which were beyond the player's reach. In short, an assistant was necessary, in fact several assistants in playing large organs like those at Harlem or Arnheim in Holland. It was almost impossible to modify the combinations of stops. All nuances, save the abrupt change from strong to soft and vice versa, were impossible.", "It remained for Cavaill\u00e9-Coll to change all this and open up new fields of usefulness for the organ. He introduced in France keyboards worthy of the name, and he gave to the higher notes, through his invention of harmonic stops, a brilliancy they had lacked. He invented wonderful combinations which allow the organist to change his combinations and to vary the tone, without the aid of an assistant and without leaving the keyboard. Even before his day a scheme had been devised of enclosing certain stops in a box protected by shutters which a pedal opened and closed at will; this permitted the finest shadings. By different processes the touch of the organ was made as delicate as that of the piano.", "For some years the Swiss organ-makers have been inventing new facilities which make the organist a sort of magician. The manifold resources of the marvellous instrument are at his command, obedient to his slightest wish.", "These resources are prodigious. The compass of the organ far surpasses that of all the instruments of the orchestra. The violin notes alone reach the same height, but with little carrying power. As for the lower tones, there is no competitor of the thirty-two-foot pipes, which go two octaves below the violoncello's low C. Between the _pianissimo_ which almost reaches the limit where sound ceases and silence begins, down to a range of formidable and terrifying power, every degree of intensity can be obtained from this magical instrument. The variety of its timbre is broad. There are flute stops of various kinds; tonal stops that approximate the timbre of stringed instruments; stops for effecting changes in which each note, formed from several pipes, bring out simultaneously its fundamental and harmonic sounds; stops which serve to imitate the instruments of the orchestra, such as the trumpet, the clarinet, and the cremona (an obsolete instrument with a timbre peculiar to itself) and the bassoon. There are celestial voices of several kinds, produced by combinations of two simultaneous stops which are not tuned in perfect unison. Then we have the famous _Vox Humana_, a favorite with the public, which is alluring even though it is tremulous and nasal, and we have the innumerable combinations of all these different stops, with the gradations that may be obtained through indefinite commingling of the tones of this marvellous palette.", "Add to all this the continual breathing of the monster's lungs which gives the sounds an incomparable and inimitable steadiness. Human beings were used for a long time to fill these lungs--blowers working away with hands and feet. We do much better now. The great organ in Albert Hall, London, is supplied with air by steam which assures the organist an inexhaustible supply. Other instruments use gas engines which are more manageable. Then, there is the hydraulic system, which is very powerful and easily used, for one has only to pull out a plug to set the bellows in motion.", "These mechanical systems, however, are not entirely free from accidents. I discovered that fact when I was concluding the first part of the _Adagio_ in Liszt's great _Fantaisie_ in the beautiful Victoria Hall in Geneva. The pipe which brought in the water burst and the organ was mute. I have always thought, perhaps wrongly, that malice had something to do with the accident.", "This Liszt _Fantaisie_ is the most extraordinary piece for the organ there is. It lasts forty minutes and the interest is sustained throughout. Just as Mozart in his _Fantaisie et Sonate in C minor_ foresaw the modern piano, so Liszt, writing this _Fantaisie_ more than half a century ago, appears to have foreseen the instrument of a thousand resources which we have to-day.", "Let us have the courage to admit, however, that these resources are only partly utilized as they can or should be. To draw from a great instrument all its possibilities, to begin with, one must understand it thoroughly, and that understanding cannot be gained over night. The organ, as we have seen, is a collection of an indefinite number of instruments. It places before the organist extraordinary means of expressing himself. No two of these instruments are precisely alike. The organ is only a theme with innumerable variations, determined by the place in which it is to be installed, by the amount of money at the builder's disposal, by his inventiveness, and, often, by his personal whims. As a result time is required for the organist to learn his instrument thoroughly. After this he is as free as the fish in the sea, and his only preoccupation is the music. Then, to play freely with the colors on his vast palette, there is but one way--he must plunge boldly into improvisation.", "Now improvisation is the particular glory of the French school, but it has been injured seriously of late by the influence of the German school. Under the pretext that an improvisation is not so good as one of Sebastian Bach's or Mendelssohn's masterpieces, young organists have stopped improvising.", "That point of view is harmful because it is absolutely false; it is simply the negation of eloquence. Consider what the legislative hall, the lecture room and the court would be like if nothing but set pieces were delivered. We are familiar with the fact that many an orator and lawyer, who is brilliant when he talks, becomes dry as dust when he tries to write. The same thing happens in music. Lef\u00e9bure-W\u00e9ly was a wonderful improviser (I can say this emphatically, for I heard him) but he left only a few unimportant compositions for the organ. I might also name some of my contemporaries who express themselves completely only through their improvisations. The organ is thought-provoking. As one touches the organ, the imagination is awakened, and the unforeseen rises from the depths of the unconscious. It is a world of its own, ever new, which will never be seen again, and which comes out of the darkness, as an enchanted island comes from the sea.", "Instead of this fairyland, we too often see only some of Sebastian Bach's or Mendelssohn's pieces repeated continuously. The pieces themselves are very fine, but they belong to concerts and are entirely out of place in church services. Furthermore, they were written for old instruments and they apply either not at all, or badly, to the modern organ. Yet there are those who think this belief spells progress.", "I am fully aware of what may be said against improvisation. There are players who improvise badly and their playing is uninteresting. But many preachers speak badly. That, however, has nothing to do with the real issue. A mediocre improvisation is always endurable, if the organist has grasped the idea that church music should harmonize with the service and aid meditation and prayer. If the organ music is played in this spirit and results in harmonious sounds rather than in precise music which is not worth writing out, it still is comparable with the old glass windows in which the individual figures can hardly be distinguished but which are, nevertheless, more charming than the finest modern windows. Such an improvisation may be better than a fugue by a great master, on the principle that nothing in art is good unless it is in its proper place.", "During the twenty years I played the organ at the Madeleine, I improvised constantly, giving my fancy the widest range. That was one of the joys of life.", "But there was a tradition that I was a severe, austere musician. The public was led to believe that I played nothing but fugues. So current was this belief that a young woman about to be married begged me to play no fugues at her wedding!", "Another young woman asked me to play funeral marches. She wanted to cry at her wedding, and as she had no natural inclination to do so, she counted on the organ to bring tears to her eyes.", "One day one of the parish vicars undertook to instruct me on this point. He told me that the Madeleine audiences were composed in the main of wealthy people who attended the Op\u00e9ra-Comique frequently, and formed musical tastes which ought to be respected.", "\"Monsieur l'abb\u00e9,\" I replied, \"when I hear from the pulpit the language of op\u00e9ra-comique, I will play music appropriate to it, and not before!\"", "Joseph Haydn, that great musician, the father of the symphony and of all modern music, has been neglected. We are too prone to forget that concerts are, in a sense, museums in which the older schools of music should be represented. Music is something besides a source of sensuous pleasure and keen emotion, and this resource, precious as it is, is only a chance corner in the wide realm of musical art. He who does not get absolute pleasure from a simple series of well-constructed chords, beautiful only in their arrangement, is not really fond of music. The same is true of the one who does not prefer the first prelude of the _Wohltemperirte Klavier_, played without gradations, just as the author wrote it for the harpsichord, to the same prelude embellished with an impassioned melody; or who does not prefer a popular melody of character or a Gregorian chant without any accompaniment to a series of dissonant and pretentious chords.", "The directors of great concerts should love music themselves and should lead the public to appreciate it. They should not allow the masters to be forgotten, for their only fault was that they were not born in our times and they never dreamed of attempting to satisfy the tastes of an unborn generation. Above all, the directors should grant recognition to masters like Joseph Haydn who were in advance of their own times and who seem now and then to belong to our own.", "The only examples of Joseph Haydn's immense work that the present generation knows are two or three symphonies, rarely and perfunctorily performed. This is the same as saying that we do not know him at all. No musician was ever more prolific or showed a greater wealth of imagination. When we examine this mine of jewels, we are astonished to find at every step a gem which we would have attributed to the invention of some modern or other. We are dazzled by their rays, and where we expect black-and-whites we find pastels grown dim with time.", "Of Haydn's one hundred and eighteen symphonies, many are simple trifles written from day to day for Prince Esterhazy's little chapel, when the master was musical director there. But after Haydn was called to London by Salomon, a director of concerts, where he had a large orchestra at his disposal, his genius took magnificent flights. Then he wrote great symphonies and in them the clarinets for the first time unfolded the resources from which the modern orchestra has profited so abundantly. Originally the clarinet played a humble r\u00f4le, as the name indicates. _Clarinetto_ is the diminutive of _clarino_, and the instrument was invented to replace the shrill tones that the trumpet lost as it gained in depth of tone.", "Old editions of Haydn's symphonies show a picturesque arrangement, in that the disposition of the orchestra is shown on the printed page. Above, is a group made up of drums and the brass. In the center is a second group--the flutes, oboes and bassoons, while the stringed instruments are at the bottom of the page. When clarinets are used, they are a part of the first group. This pretty arrangement has, unfortunately, not been followed in the modern editions of these symphonies. In the works written in London the clarinet has utterly forgotten its origins. It has left the somewhat plebeian world of the brasses and has gained admittance to the more refined society of the woods. Haydn, in his first attempts, took advantage of the beautiful heavy tones, \"_chalumeau_,\" and the flexibility and marvellous range of a beautiful instrument.", "During his stay in London Haydn sketched an _Orfeo_ which he never completed, as the theatre which ordered it failed before it was finished. Only fragments of the work remain, and, fortunately enough, these have been engraved in an orchestra score. These fragments are uneven in value. The dialogue, or recitative, which should bind them together was lost and so we are unable to judge them fairly. Among the fragments is a brilliant aria on Eurydice which is rather ridiculous, while another on Eurydice dying is charming. We also find music for mysterious _English horns_; it is written as for clarinets in B flat and reaches heights which are impossible for the instrument we now know as the English horn. There is also a beautiful bass part. This has been provided with Latin words and is sung in churches. This aria was assigned to a Creon who does not appear in the other fragments. One scene shows Eurydice running up and down the banks pursued by demons. Another depicts the death of Orpheus, killed by the Bacchantes. This score is a curiosity and nothing more, and a reading causes no regret that the work was not completed.", "Like Gluck, Joseph Haydn had the rare advantage of developing constantly. He did not reach the height of his genius until an age when the finest faculties are, ordinarily, in a decline. He astounded the musical world with his _Creation_, in which he displayed a fertility of imagination and a magnificence of orchestral richness that the oratorio had never known before. Emboldened by his success he wrote the _Seasons_, a colossal work, the most varied and the most picturesque in the history of ancient or modern music. In this instance the oratorio is no longer entirely religious. It gives an audacious picture of nature with realistic touches which are astonishing even now. There is an artistic imitation of the different sounds in nature, as the rustling of the leaves, the songs of the birds in the woods and on the farm, and the shrill notes of the insects. Above all that is the translation into music of the profound emotions to which the different aspects of nature give birth, as the freshness of the forests, the stifling heat before a storm, the storm itself, and the wonderful sunset that follows. Then there is a huntsman's chorus which strikes an entirely different note. There are grape harvests, with the mad dances that follow them. There is the winter, with a poignant introduction which reminds us of pages in Schumann. But be reassured, the author does not leave us to the rigors of the cold. He takes us into a farmhouse where the women are spinning and where the peasants are drawn about the fire, listening to a funny tale and laughing immoderately with a gaiety which has never been surpassed.", "But this gigantic work does not end without giving us a glimpse of Heaven, for with one grand upward burst of flight, Haydn reaches the realms where Handel and Beethoven preceded him. He equals them and ends his picture in a dazzling blaze of light.", "But all this is not what I started out to say. I wanted to write about a delicate, touching, reserved and precious work by the same author--_The Seven Words of Christ on the Cross_. This work has appeared in three forms--for an orchestra and chorus, for an orchestra alone, and for a quartet. When I was a young man, they used to say in Paris that this work was originally written for a quartet, then developed for an orchestra, and, finally, the voices were added.", "Chance took me to Cadiz, once upon a time, and there I was given the true story of this beautiful piece of work. To my astonishment I learned that it had been first performed in the city of Cadiz. They even spoke of a competition in which Haydn won the prize, but there was never any such contest. The work was ordered from the author, but the question is who ordered it. Two religious circles, the Cathedral and the Cueva del Rosario, both lay claim to the initiative. I have gone over all the evidence in this dispute which is of little interest to us, for the only interest is the origin of the composition. There is not the slightest doubt that the _Seven Words_ was written in the first place for an orchestra in 1785, and its destination, as we shall see, was settled by the author himself.", "In his _Memoires pour la Biographie et la Bibliographie de l'ile de Cadix_, Don Francisco de Miton, Marquis de Meritos, relates that he corresponded with Haydn and ordered this composition which was to be performed at the Cathedral in Cadiz. According to his account Haydn said that \"the composition was due more to what Se\u00f1or Milton wrote than to his own invention, for it showed every motif so marvellously that on reading the instructions he seemed to read the music itself.\"", "If the Marquis was not boasting, we must confess that the ingenuous Haydn was not so ingenuous as has been thought, and that he knew how to flatter his patrons.", "In 1801 Breitkopf and Haertel published the work with the addition of the vocal parts at Leipzig. This edition had a preface by the author in which he said:", "About fifteen years ago, a cur\u00e9 at Cadiz engaged me to write some passages of instrumental music on the Seven Words of Christ on the Cross. It was the custom at that time to play an oratorio at the Cathedral during Holy Week, and they took great pains to give as much solemnity as possible. The walls, the windows and the pillars of the church were hung in black, and only a single light in the centre shone in the sanctuary. The doors were closed at mid-day and the orchestra began to play. After the opening ceremonies the bishop entered the pulpit, pronounced one of the \"Seven Words\" and delivered a few words inspired by it. Then he descended, knelt before the altar, and remained there for some time. This pause was relieved by the music. The bishop ascended and descended six times more and each time, after his homily, music was played. My music was to be adapted to these ceremonies.", "The problem of writing seven _adagios_ to be performed consecutively, each one to last ten minutes, without wearying the audience, was not an easy one to solve, and I soon recognized the impossibility of making my music conform to the prescribed limits.", "The work was written and printed without words. Later the opportunity of adding them was offered, so the oratorio which Breitkopf and Haertel publish to-day is a complete work and, so far as the vocal part is concerned, entirely new.", "The kind reception which it has received among amateurs makes me hope that the entire public will welcome it with the same kindness.", "Michel Haydn, Joseph's brother and the author of some highly esteemed religious compositions, has been generally credited with the addition of the vocal parts to the _Seven Words_. Joseph Haydn did not say that this was the case, but it would seem that if he did the work himself he would have said so in his preface.", "This vocal part, however, adds nothing to the value of the work. And it is of no great consequence who the author of the arrangement for the quartet was. At the time there were many amateurs who played on stringed instruments. They used to meet frequently and everything in music was arranged for quartets just as now everything is arranged for piano duets. Some of Beethoven's sonatas were arranged in this form. The piano killed the quartet, and it is a great pity, for the quartet is the purest form of instrumental music. It is the first form--the fountain of Hippocrene. Now instrumental music drinks from every cup and the result is that many times it seems drunk.", "To return to the _Seven Words_. Their symphonic form is the only one worth considering. They are eloquent enough without the aid of voices, for their charm penetrates. Unlike the _Creation_ and the _Seasons_ they do not demand extraordinary means of execution, and nothing is easier than to give them.", "The opera houses are closed on Good Friday, and it used to be the custom to give evening concerts, vaguely termed \"Sacred Concerts,\" because their programmes were made up wholly or in part of religious music. This good custom has disappeared and with it the opportunity to give the public such delightful works as the _Seven Words_, and so many other things which harmonize with the character of the day.", "At one of these Sacred Concerts, Pasdeloup presented on the same evening the _Credo_ from Liszt's _Missa Solemnis_ and the one from Cherubini's _Messe du Sacre_. Liszt's _Credo_ was received with a storm of hisses, while Cherubini's was praised to the skies. I could not help thinking--I was somewhat unjust, for Cherubini's work has merit--of the people of Jerusalem who acclaimed Barrabas and demanded the crucifixion of Jesus.", "The Liszt centenary was celebrated everywhere with elaborate festivities, perhaps most notably at Budapest where the _Missa Solemnis_ was sung in the great cathedral--that alone would have been sufficient glory for the composer. At Weimar, which, during his lifetime, Liszt made a sort of musical Mecca, they gave a performance of his deeply charming oratorio _Die Legende von der Heiligen Elisabeth_. The festival at Heidelberg was of special interest as it was organized by the General Association of German Musicians which Liszt had founded fifty years before. Each year this society gives in a different city a festival which lasts several days. It admits foreign members and I was once a member as Berlioz's successor on Liszt's own invitation. Disagreements separated us, and I had had no relation with the society for a number of years when they asked me to take part in this festival. A refusal would have been misunderstood and I had to accept, although the idea of performing at my age alongside such _virtuosi_ as Risler, Busoni, and Friedheim, in the height of their talent, was not encouraging.", "The festival lasted four days and there were six concerts--four with the orchestra and a chorus. They gave the oratorio _Christus_, an enormous work which takes up all the time allowed for one concert; the Dante and Faust symphonies, and the symphonic poems _Ce qu'on entend sur la montagne_ and _Tasso_, to mention only the most important works.", "The oratorio _Christus_ lacks the fine unity of the _Saint Elisabeth_. But the two works are alike in being divided into a series of separate episodes. While the different episodes in _Saint Elisabeth_ solve the difficult problem of creating variety and retaining unity, the parts of _Christus_ are somewhat unrelated. There is something for every taste. Certain parts are unqualifiedly admirable; others border on the theatrical; still others are nearly or entirely liturgical, while, finally, some are picturesque, although there are some almost confusing. Like Gounod, Liszt was sometimes deceived and attributed to ordinary and simple sequences of chords a profound significance which escaped the great majority of his hearers. There are some pages of this sort in _Christus_.", "But there are beautiful and wonderful things in this vast work. If we regret that the author lingered too long in his imitation of the _Pifferari_ of the Roman campagna, on the other hand, we are delighted by the symphonic interlude _Les Bergers \u00e0 la Cr\u00e8che_. It is very simple, but in an inimitable simplicity of taste which is the secret of great artists alone. It is surprising that this interlude does not appear in the repertoire of all concerts.", "The Dante symphony has not established itself in the repertoires as has the Faust symphony. It was performed for the first time in Paris at a concert I organized and managed at a time when Liszt's works were distrusted. Along with the Dante symphony we had the Andante (Gretchen) from the Faust symphony, the symphonic poem _Fest Kloenge_, a charming work which is never played now, and still other works. It would be hard to imagine all the opposition I had to overcome in giving that concert. There was the hostility of the public, the ill-will of the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Italien which rented me its famous hall but which sullenly opposed a proper announcement of the concert, the insubordination of the orchestra, the demands of the singers for more pay--they imagined that Liszt would pay the expenses--and, finally, complete--and expected failure. My only object was to lay a foundation for the future, nothing more. In spite of everything I managed to get a creditable performance of the Dante symphony and I had the pleasure of hearing it for the first time.", "The first part (the Inferno) is wonderfully impressive with its _Francesca da Rimini_ interlude, in which burn all the fires of Italian passion. The second part (Purgatory and Paradise) combines the most intense and poignant charm. It contains a fugue episode of unsurpassed beauty.", "_Ce qu'on entend sur la montagne_ is, perhaps, the best of the famous symphonic poems. The author was inspired by Victor Hugo's poetry and reproduced its spirit admirably. When will this typical work appear in the concert repertoires? When will orchestra conductors get tired of presenting the three or four Wagnerian works they repeat _ad nauseum_, when they can be heard at the Op\u00e9ra under better conditions, and Schubert's insignificant _Unfinished Symphony_.", "The _Christus_ oratorio was given at the first concert of the festival at Heidelberg. It lasted three hours and a half and is so long that I would not dare to advise concert managers to try such an adventure. The performance was sublime. It was given in a newly constructed square hall. Cavaill\u00e9-Coll, who knew acoustics, used to advise the square hall for concerts but nobody would listen to him. Three hundred chorus singers, many from a distance, were supported by an orchestra that was large, but, in my opinion, insufficient to stand up against this mass of voices. Furthermore, the orchestra was placed below the level of the stage, as in a theatre, while the voices sounded freely above. Two harps, one on the east side of the stage and one on the west, saw each other from afar,--a pleasingly decorative device, but as annoying to the ear as pleasing to the eye. The chorus and the four soloists--their task was exceedingly arduous--triumphed completely over the difficulties of this immense work and all the varied and delicate nuances were rendered to perfection.", "Liszt was far from professing the disdain for the limitations of the human voice that Wagner and Berlioz did. On the contrary he treated it as if it were a queen or a goddess, and it is to be regretted that his tastes did not lead him to work for the stage. Parts of _Saint Elisabeth_ show that he would have succeeded and the fashion of having operas for the orchestra, accompanied by voices, which we enjoy to-day, might have been avoided. He discovered a method, peculiarly his own, of writing choruses. His manner has never been imitated, but it is ingenious and has many advantages. The only trouble about it is that the singers have to take care of details and shadings which is too often the least of their worries. The German societies, where the members sing for pleasure, and not for a salary, are careful to excess, if there can be excess in such matters, and it is their great good fortune to be the interpreters of choruses written in this manner.", "It is impossible to give an analysis of this vast work here. We have already spoken of the charming interlude, _Les Bergers \u00e0 la Cr\u00e8che_. This pastoral is followed by _Marche des Rois Mages_, a pretty piece, but a little overdeveloped for its intrinsic worth. The vocal parts, _B\u00e9atitudes_ and _Le Pater Noster_, would be more suitable in a church than in a concert hall. Then come some most brilliant pages, _La Temp\u00eate sur le lac de Thib\u00e9riade_, and _Le Mont des Oliviers_, with its baritone solo, and finally, the _Stabat Mater_, where great beauties are combined with terrible length. But nothing in the whole work impressed me more than Christ's entrance to Jerusalem (orchestra, chorus, and soloist) for the reading alone gives no idea of it. Here the author reached the heights. That also describes the delightful effect of the children's chorus singing in the distance _O Filii et Filiae_, harmonised with perfect taste.", "While I listened to this beautiful work, I could not help thinking of the great oratorios which crowned Gounod's musical career so gloriously. Liszt and Gounod differed entirely in their musical temperaments, yet in their oratorios they met on common ground. In both there was the same drawing away from the old forms of oratorio, the same search for realism in the expression of the text in music, the same respect for Latin prosody, and the same belief in simplicity of style. But while there is renunciation in the simplicity of Liszt, who threw aside worldly finery to wear the frock of a penitent, on the contrary Gounod appears to return to his original bent with an almost holy joy. This is easily explained. Liszt finished his life in a cassock, while Gounod began his in one. So, despite Liszt's superior refinement, and putting aside exceptional achievements, in this branch of art Gounod was the victor. As there is an _odor di femina_ there is a _parfum d'\u00e9glise_, well known to Catholics. Gounod's oratorios are impregnated with this, while it is found in _Christus_ very, very feebly, if at all. The _Missa Solemnis_ must be examined to find it to any extent in Liszt's work.", "All the necessary elements were combined at Heidelberg to produce a magnificent production of Faust and Dante. The orchestra of more than one hundred musicians was perfect. The period when the wind instruments in Germany were wanting both in correctness and quality of sound has passed. But the orchestra conductors have to be taken into account. In our day these gentlemen are _virtuosi_. Their personalities are not subservient to the music, but the music to them. It is the springboard on which they perform and parade their all embracing personalities. They add their own inventions to the author's meaning. Sometimes they draw out the wind instruments so that the musicians have to cut a phrase at the end to catch their breath; again they affect a mad and unrestrained rapidity which allows time neither to play nor to hear the sounds. They hurry or retard the movement for no reason besides their individual caprice or because the author did not indicate them. They perpetrate music of such a disorganized character that the musicians are utterly bewildered, and hesitate in their entrances on account of their inability to distinguish one measure from another.", "The delightful _Purgatoire_ has become a deadly bore, and the enchanting _Mephistopheles_ has been riddled as by a hailstorm. Familiarity with such excesses made me particularly appreciative of the excellent performance that Wolfrum, the musical director, obtained in the vast _Christus_ concert.", "Among the conductors was Richard Strauss who cannot be passed over without a word. Certainly no one will hope to find moderation and serenity in this artist or be surprised if he gives his temperament free rein, and rides on to victory undisturbed by the ruins he leaves behind. But he lacks neither intelligence nor elegance, and if he sometimes goes too fast he never overemphasizes slowness. When he is conducting, we need not fear the desert of Sahara where others sometimes lead us. Under his direction _Tasso_ displayed all its wealth of resources and the jewel-like _Mephisto-Walzer_ shone more brightly than ever before.", "I can speak but briefly of the numerous soloists. We neither judge nor compare such talents as those of Busoni, Friedheim, and Risler. We are satisfied with admiring them. However, if a prize must be awarded, I should give it to Risler for his masterly interpretation of the great _Sonata in B minor_. He made the most of it in every way, in all its power and in all its delicacy. When it is given in this way, it is one of the finest sonatas imaginable. But such a performance is rare, for it is beyond the average artist. The strength of an athlete, the lightness of a bird, capriciousness, charm, and a perfect understanding of style in general and of the style of this composer in particular are the qualifications needed to perform this work. It is far too difficult for most _virtuosi_, however talented they may be.", "Among the women singers I shall only mention Madame Cahier from the Viennese Opera. She is a great artist with a wonderful voice and her interpretation of several _lieder_ made them wonderfully worth while. Madame Cahier interpreted the part of Dalila at Vienna with Dalmores, so it can easily be appreciated how much pleasure I took in hearing her.", "A final word about the Dante Symphony. I have read somewhere that Liszt used pages to produce an effect which Berlioz accomplished in the apparition of Mephistopheles in _Faust_ with three notes. This comparison is unjust. Berlioz's happy discovery is a work of genius and he alone could have invented it. But the sudden appearance of the Devil is one thing and the depiction of Hell quite another. Berlioz tried such a depiction at the end of the Damnation, and in spite of the strange vocabulary of the chorus, \"Irimiru Karabrao, Sat raik Irkimour,\" and other pretty tricks, he succeeded no better than Liszt. As a matter of fact the opposite was the case.", "The reading of the score of Berlioz's _Requiem_ makes it appear singularly old-fashioned, but this is true of most of the romantic dramas, which, like the _Requiem_, show up better in actual performance. It is easy to rail at the vehemence of the Romanticists, but it is not so easy to equal the effect of _Hernani_, _Lucr\u00e8ce Borgia_ and the _Symphonie fantastique_ on the public. For with all their faults these works had a marvellous success. The truth is that their vehemence was sincere and not artificial. The Romanticists had faith in their works and there is nothing like faith to produce lasting results.", "Reicha and Leuseur were, as we know, Berlioz's instructors. Leuseur was the author of numerous works and wrote a good deal of church music. Some of his religious works were really beautiful, but he had strange obsessions. Berlioz greatly admired his master and could not help showing, especially in his earlier works, traces of this admiration. That is the reason for the syncopated and jerky passages without rhyme or reason and which can only be explained by his unconscious imitation of Leuseur's faults. In imitating a model the resemblances occur in the faults and not in the excellences, for the latter are inimitable. So the excellences of the _Requiem_ are not due to Leuseur but to Berlioz. He had already thrown off the trammels of school and shown all the richness of his vigorous originality to which the value of his scores is due.", "In his _Memoirs_ Berlioz related the tribulations of his _Requiem_. It was ordered by the government, laid aside for a time, and, finally, performed at the Invalides on the occasion of the capture of Constantine (in Algeria) and the funeral services of General Damr\u00e9mont. He was astonished at the lack of sympathy and even actual hostility that he encountered. It would have been more astonishing if he had experienced anything else.", "We must remember that at this time Berton, who sang _Quand on est toujours vertuex, on aime \u00e0 voir lever l'aurore_, passed for a great man. Beethoven's symphonies were a novelty, in Paris at least, and a scandal. Haydn's symphonies inspired a critic to write, \"What a noise, what a noise!\" Orchestras were merely collections of thirty or forty musicians.", "We can imagine, therefore, the stupefaction and horror when a young man, just out of school, demanded fifty violins, twenty violas, twenty violoncellos, eighteen contrabasses, four flutes, four oboes, four clarinets, eight bassoons, twelve horns, and a chorus of two hundred voices as a minimum. And that is not all. The _Tuba Mirum_ necessitates an addition of thirty-eight trumpets and trombones, divided into four orchestras and placed at the four cardinal points of the compass. Besides, there have to be eight pairs of drums, played by ten drummers, four tam-tams, and ten cymbals.", "The story of this array of drums is rather interesting. Reicha, Berlioz's first teacher, had the original idea of playing drum taps in chords of three or four beats. In order to try out this effect, he composed a choral piece, _L'Harmonie des Sph\u00e8res_, which was published in connection with his _Trait\u00e9 d'Harmonie_. But Reicha's genius did not suffice for this task. He was a good musician, but no more than that. His choral piece was insignificant and remained a dead letter. Berlioz took this lost effect and used it in his _Tuba Mirum_.", "However, it must be confessed that this effect does not come up to expectations. In a church or a concert hall we hear a confused and terrifying mingling of sounds, and from time to time we note a change in the depth of tone but we are unable to distinguish the pitch of the chords.", "I shall never forget the impression this _Tuba Mirum_ made on me when I first heard it at St. Eustache under Berlioz's own direction. It amounted to an absolute neglect of the author's directions. The beginning of the work is marked _moderato_, later, as the brass comes in, the movement is quickened and becomes _andante maestro_. Most of the time the _moderato_ was interpreted as an _allegro_, and the _andante maestro_ as a simple _moderato_. If the terrific fanfare did not become, as some one ventured to call it, a \"Setting Out for the Hunt,\" it might well have been the accompaniment for a sovereign's entrance to his capital. In order to give this fanfare its grandiose character, the author did not take easy refuge in the wailings of a minor key, but he burst into the splendors of a major key. A certain grandeur of movement alone can preserve its gigantesque quality and impression of power.", "Granting all his good intentions, in trying to give us a suggestion of the last judgment by his accumulation of brass, drums, cymbals, and tam-tams, Berlioz makes us think of Thor among the giants trying to empty the drinking-horn which was filled from the sea, and only succeeding in lowering it a little. Yet even that was an accomplishment.", "Berlioz spoke scornfully of Mozart's _Tuba Mirum_ with its single trombone. \"One trombone,\" he exclaimed, \"when a hundred would be none too many!\" Berlioz wanted to make us really hear the trumpets of the archangels. Mozart with the seven notes of his one trombone suggested the same idea and the suggestion is sufficient.", "We must not forget, however, that here we are in the midst of a world of romanticism, in a world of color and picturesqueness, which could not content itself with so little. And we must remember this fact, if we would not be irritated by the oddities of _L'Hostias_, with its deep trombone notes which seem to come from the very depths of Hell. There is no use in trying to find out what these notes mean. Berlioz told us himself that he discovered these notes at a time when they were almost unknown and he wanted to use them. The contrast between these terrifying notes and the wailing of the flutes is especially curious. We find nothing analogous to this anywhere else.", "The delightful _Purgatoire_, where the author sees a chorus of souls in Purgatory, is much better. His Purgatory has no punishments nor any griefs save the awaiting, the long and painful awaiting, of eternal happiness. There is a processional in which the fugue and melody alternate in the most felicitous manner. There are sighs and plaints, all haunting in their extreme expressiveness, a great variety beneath an appearance of monotony, and from time to time two wailing notes. These notes are always the same, as the chorus gives them as a plaint, and they are both affecting and artistic. At the end comes a dim ray of light and hope. This is the only one in the work save the Amen at the end, for Faith and Hope should not be looked for here. The supplications sound like prayers which do not expect to be answered. No one would dare to describe this work as profane, but whether it is religious or not is a question. As Boschot has said, what it expresses above all is terror in the presence of annihilation.", "When the _Requiem_ was played at the Trocad\u00e9ro, the audience was greatly impressed and filed out slowly. They did not say, \"What a masterpiece!\" but \"What an orchestra leader!\" Nowadays people go to see a conductor direct the orchestra just as they go to hear a tenor, and they arrogate to themselves the right to judge the conductors as they do the tenors. But what a fine sport it is! The qualities of an orchestra conductor which the public appreciates are his elegance, his gestures, his precision, and the expressiveness of his mimicry, all of which are more often directed at the audience than at the orchestra. But all these things are of secondary consideration. What makes up an orchestra conductor's worth are the excellence of execution he obtains from the musicians and the perfect interpretation of the author's meaning--which the audience does not understand. If such an important detail as the author's meaning is obscured and slighted, if a work is disfigured by absurd movements and by an expression which is entirely different from what the author wanted, the public may be dazzled and an execrable conductor, provided his poses are good, may fascinate his audience and be praised to the skies.", "Formerly the conductor never saluted his audience. The understanding was that the work and not the conductor was applauded. The Italians and Germans changed all that. Lamoureux was the first to introduce this exotic custom in France. The public was a little surprised at first, but they soon got used to it. In Italy the conductor comes on the stage with the artists to salute the audience. There is nothing more laughable than to see him, as the last note of an opera dies away, jump down from his stand and run like mad to reach the stage in time.", "The excellence of the work of English choristers has been highly and justly praised. Perhaps it would be fairer not to praise them so unreservedly when we are so severe on our own. Justice often leaves something to be desired. At all events it must be admitted that Berlioz treated the voices in an unfortunate way. Like Beethoven, he made no distinction between a part for a voice and an instrument. While except for a few rare passages it does not fall as low as the atrocities which disfigure the grandiose _Mass in D_, the vocal part of the _Requiem_ is awkwardly written. Singers are ill at ease in it, for the timbre and regularity of the voice resent such treatment. The tenor's part is so written that he is to be congratulated on getting through it without any accident, and nothing more can be expected of him.", "What a pity it was that Berlioz did not fall in love with an Italian singer instead of an English tragedienne! Cupid might have wrought a miracle. The author of the _Requiem_ would have lost none of his good qualities, but he might have gained, what, for the lack of a better phrase, is called the fingering of the voice, the art of handling it intelligently and making it give without an effort the best effect of which it is capable. But Berlioz had a horror even of the Italian language, musical as that is. As he said in his _Memoirs_, this aversion hid from him the true worth of _Don Juan_ and _Le Nozze di Figaro_. One wonders whether he knew that his idol, Gluck, wrote music for Italian texts not only in the case of his first works but also in _Orph\u00e9e_ and _Alceste_. And whether he knew that the aria _\"O malheureuse Iphigenie\"_ was an Italian song badly translated into French. Perhaps he was ignorant of all this in his youth for Berlioz was a genius, not a scholar.", "The word genius tells the whole story. Berlioz wrote badly. He maltreated voices and sometimes permitted himself the strangest freaks. Nevertheless he is one of the commanding figures of musical art. His great works remind us of the Alps with their forests, glaciers, sunlight, waterfalls and chasms. There are people who do not like the Alps. So much the worse for them.", "Alfred de Musset covered Maria Malibran's tomb with immortal flowers and he also told us the story of Pauline Garcia's debut. There is also something about it in Th\u00e9ophile Gautier's writings. It is clear from both accounts that her first appearance was an extraordinary occasion. Natures such as hers reveal themselves at once to those who know and do not have to wait to arrive until they are in full bloom. Pauline was very young at the time, and soon afterwards she married M. Viardot, manager of the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Italien and one of the finest men of his day. She went abroad to develop her talent, but she returned in 1849 when Meyerbeer named her to create the r\u00f4le of Fides in _Le Proph\u00e8te_.", "Her voice was tremendously powerful, prodigious in its range, and it overcame all the difficulties in the art of singing. But this marvellous voice did not please everyone, for it was by no means smooth and velvety. Indeed, it was a little harsh and was likened to the taste of a bitter orange. But it was just the voice for a tragedy or an epic, for it was superhuman rather than human. Light things like Spanish songs and Chopin mazurkas, which she used to transpose so that she could sing them, were completely transformed by that voice and became the playthings of an Amazon or of a giantess. She lent an incomparable grandeur to tragic parts and to the severe dignity of the oratorio.", "I never had the pleasure of hearing Madame Malibran, but Rossini told me about her. He preferred her sister. Madame Malibran, he said, had the advantage of beauty. In addition, she died young and left a memory of an artist in full possession of all her powers. She was not the equal of her sister as a musician and could not have survived the decline of her voice as the latter did.", "Madame Viardot was not beautiful, indeed, she was far from it. The portrait by Ary Scheffer is the only one which shows this unequalled woman truthfully and gives some idea of her strange and powerful fascination. What made her even more captivating than her talent as a singer was her personality--one of the most amazing I have ever known. She spoke and wrote fluently Spanish, French, Italian, English and German. She was in touch with all the current literature of these countries and in correspondence with people all over Europe.", "She did not remember when she learned music. In the Garcia family music was in the air they breathed. So she protested against the tradition which represented her father as a tyrant who whipped his daughters to make them sing. I have no idea how she learned the secrets of composition, but save for the management of the orchestra she knew them well. She wrote numerous _lieder_ on Spanish and German texts and all of these show a faultless diction. But contrary to the custom of most composers who like nothing better than to show their compositions, she concealed hers as though they were indiscretions. It was exceedingly difficult to persuade her to let one hear them, although the least were highly creditable. Once she sang a Spanish popular song, a wild haunting thing, with which Rubinstein fell madly in love. It was several years before she would admit that she wrote it herself.", "She wrote brilliant operettas in collaboration with Tourguenief, but they were never published and were performed only in private. One anecdote will show her versatility as a composer. She was a friend of Chopin and Liszt and her tastes were strongly futuristic. M. Viardot, on the contrary, was a reactionary in music. He even found Beethoven too advanced. One day they had a guest who was also a reactionary. Madame Viardot sang to them a wonderful work with recitative, aria and final allegro, which they praised to the skies. She had written it expressly for the occasion. I have read this work and even the cleverest would have been deceived.", "But it must not be thought from this that her compositions were mere imitations. On the contrary they were extremely original. The only explanation why those that were published have remained unknown and why so many were unpublished is that this admirable artist had a horror of publicity. She spent half her life in teaching pupils and the world knew nothing about it.", "During the Empire the Viardots used to give in their apartment on Thursday evenings really fine musical festivals which my surviving contemporaries still remember. From the salon in which the famous portrait by Ary Scheffer was hung and which was devoted to ordinary instrumental and vocal music, we went down a short staircase to a gallery filled with valuable paintings, and finally to an exquisite organ, one of Cavaill\u00e9-Coll's masterpieces. In this temple dedicated to music we listened to arias from the oratorios of Handel and Mendelssohn. She had sung them in London, but could not get a hearing for them in the concerts in Paris as they were averse to such vast compositions. I had the honor to be her regular accompanist both at the organ and the piano.", "But this passionate lover of song was an all-round musician. She played the piano admirably, and when she was among friends she overcame the greatest difficulties. Before her Thursday audiences, however, she limited herself to chamber music, with a special preference for Henri Reber's duets for the piano and the violin. These delicate, artistic works are unknown to the amateurs of to-day. They seem to prefer to the pure juice of the grape in crystal glasses poisonous potions in cups of gold. They must have orgies, sumptuous ceilings, a deadly luxury. They do not understand the poet who sings, _\"O rus, quando te aspiciam!\"_ They do not appreciate the great distinction of simplicity. Reber's muse is not for them.", "Madame Viardot was as learned a musician as any one could be and she was among the first subscribers to the complete edition of Sebastian Bach's works. We know what an astounding revelation that work was. Each year brought ten religious cantatas, and each year brought us new surprises in the unexpected variety and impressiveness of the work. We thought we had known Sebastian Bach, but now we learned how really to know him. We found him a writer of unusual versatility and a great poet. His _Wohltemperirte Klavier_ had given us only a hint of all this. The beauties of this famous work needed exposition for, in the absence of definite instructions, opinions differed. In the cantatas the meaning of the words serves as an indication and through the analogy between the forms of expression, it is easy to see pretty clearly what the author intended in his _Klavier_ pieces.", "One fine day the annual volume was found to contain a cantata in several parts written for a contralto solo accompanied by stringed instruments, oboes and an organ obligato. The organ was there and the organist as well. So we assembled the instruments, Stockhausen, the baritone, was made the leader of the little orchestra, and Madame Viardot sang the cantata. I suspect that the author had never heard his work sung in any such manner. I cherish the memory of that day as one of the most precious in my musical career. My mother and M. Viardot were the only listeners to this exceptional exhibition. We did not dare to repeat it before hearers who were not ready for it. What would now be a great success would have fallen flat at that time. And nothing is more irritating than to see an audience cold before a beautiful work. It is far better to keep to one's self treasures which will be unappreciated.", "One thing will always stand in the way of the vogue of Sebastian Bach's vocal works--the difficulty of translation. When they are rendered into French, they lose all their charm and oftentimes become ridiculous.", "One of the most amazing characteristics of Madame Viardot's talent was her astonishing facility in assimilating all styles of music. She was trained in the old Italian music and she revealed its beauties as no one else has ever done. As for myself, I saw only its faults. Then she sang Schumann and Gluck and even Glinka whom she sang in Russian. Nothing was foreign to her; she was at home everywhere.", "She was a great friend of Chopin and she remembered his playing almost exactly and could give the most valuable directions about the way he interpreted his works. I learned from her that the great pianist's (great musician's, rather) execution was much simpler than has been generally supposed. It was as far removed from any manifestation of bad taste as it was from cold correctness. She told me the secret of the true _tempo rubato_ without which Chopin's music is disfigured. It in no way resembles the dislocations by which it is so often caricatured.", "I have spoken of her great talent as a pianist. We saw this one evening at a concert given by Madame Schumann. After Madame Viardot had sung some of Schumann's _lieder_ with the great pianist playing the accompaniments, the two great artists played the illustrious author's duet for two pianos, which fairly bristles with difficulties, _with equal virtuosity_.", "When Madame Viardot's voice began to break, she was advised to devote herself to the piano. If she had, she would have found a new career and a second reputation. But she did not want to make the change, and for several years she presented the sorry spectacle of genius contending with adversity. Her voice was broken, stubborn, uneven, and intermittent. An entire generation knew her only in a guise unworthy of her.", "Her immoderate love of music was the cause of the early modification of her voice. She wanted to sing everything she liked and she sang Valentine in _Les Huguenots_, Donna Anna in _Don Juan_, besides other r\u00f4les she should never have undertaken if she wanted to preserve her voice. She came to realize this at the end of her life. \"Don't do as I did,\" she once told a pupil. \"I wanted to sing everything, and I ruined my voice.\"", "We know, or, rather we used to know--for we are beginning to forget that there is an admirable edition of Gluck's principal works. This edition was due to the interest of an unusual woman, Mlle. Fanny Pelletan, who devoted a part of her fortune to this real monument and to fulfill a wish Berlioz expressed in one of his works. Mlle. Pelletan was an unusually intelligent woman and an accomplished musician, but she needed some one to help her in this large and formidable task. She was unassuming and distrusted her own powers, so that she secured as a collaborator a German musician, named Damcke, who had lived in Paris a long time and who was highly esteemed. He gave her the moral support she needed and some bad advice as well, which she felt obliged to follow. This collaboration accounts for the change of the contralto parts to counter-tenors. It also accounts for the fact that in every instance the parts for the clarinets are indicated in C, in this way attributing to the author a formal intention he never had. Gluck wrote the parts for the clarinets without bothering whether the player--to whom he left a freedom of choice and the work of transposition--would use his instrument in C, B, or A. This method was not peculiar to Gluck. Other composers used it as well, and traces of it are found even in Auber's works.", "After Damcke's death Mlle. Pelletan got me to help her in this work. I wanted to change the method, but the edition would have lost its unity and she would not consent. It was time that Damcke's collaboration ended. He belonged to the tribe of German professors who have since become legion. Due to their baneful influence, in a short time, when the old editions have disappeared, the works of Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven, even of Chopin, will be all but unrecognizable. The works of Sebastian Bach and Handel will be the only ones in existence in their pristine purity of form, thanks to the admirable editions of the _Bach und H\u00e4ndel Gesselschaft_. When Mlle. Pelletan brought me into the work, the two _Iphigenie_ had been published; _Alceste_ was about to be, and _Armide_ was ready. In _Armide_ Damcke had been entirely carried away by his zeal for \"improvements\"--a zeal that can do so much harm. It was time this was stopped. Not only had he corrected imaginary faults here and there, but he had also inserted things of his own invention. He had even gone so far as to re-orchestrate the ballet music, in the na\u00efve belief that he was bringing out the author's real meaning better than he had done himself. It took an enormous amount of time to undo this mischief, for I distrusted somewhat my own lights and Mlle. Pelletan had too high an opinion of Damcke's work and did not dare to override his judgment.", "That excellent woman did not live to see the end of her work. She began the preparation of Orph\u00e9e, but she died almost at once. So I was left to finish the score alone without that valuable experience and masterly insight by which she solved the most difficult problems. And there were real enigmas to be solved at every step. The old engraved scores of Gluck's works reproduced his manuscripts faithfully enough, but they bore evidence of carelessness and amazing inaccuracy. They are mere sketches instead of complete scores. Many details are vague and vagueness is not permissible in a serious edition. It follows that the different editions of Gluck's works published in the Nineteenth Century, however sumptuous or careful they may be, are worthless. The Pelletan edition alone can be consulted with confidence, because we were the only ones to have all extant and authentic documents in the library at the Op\u00e9ra to set us right. We had scores copied for actual performances on the stage and portions of orchestral parts of incalculable value. In addition, we had no aim or preoccupation in elaborating this material other than to reconstitute as closely as possible the thought of the author.", "Switzerland is a country where artistic productions are not unusual. Every year we have reports of some grandiose performance in which the people take part themselves. They come from every direction to help, even from a considerable distance, thanks to the many means of communication in that delightful land. It is not surprising, therefore, to learn that a theatre has been built in the pretty town of M\u00e9zi\u00e8res, near Lusanne, for the performance of the works of a young poet, named Morax. These works are dramas with choruses, and the surrounding country furnishes the singers. The work given in 1911 was Allenor--the music by Gustave Doret--and it was a great success.", "Gustave Doret is a real artist and he never for a moment thought of keeping the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Jorat for his own exclusive use. He dreamt of giving Gluck's works in their original form, for they are always altered and changed according to the fancies or incompetency of the performers or directors. They formed a large and influential committee and a substantial guarantee fund was subscribed. Then they gave a brilliant banquet at which the Princess of Brancovan was present. And Paderewski, one of the most enthusiastic promotors of the enterprise, delivered an eloquent address. No one should be surprised at either his zeal or his eloquence. Paderewski is not only a pianist; he is a man of great intellect as well,--a great artist who permits himself the luxury of playing the piano marvellously.", "As he knew that I had spent several years in studying Gluck's works under the microscope, so to speak, Gustave Doret did me the honor to ask my advice. His choice for the opening work was _Orph\u00e9e_, which requires only three principals, Orpheus, Eurydice, and Love. It has become the custom to add a fourth, a Happy Spirit, but this spirit is one of Carvalho's inventions and has no reason for existence.", "There are, however, two _Orph\u00e9e_. The first is _Orfeo_ which was written in Italian, on Calzabigi's text, and was first presented at Venice in 1761. The r\u00f4le of Orpheus in this score was written for a contralto and was designed for the eunuch Quadagni. The Venetian engravers of that day were either incompetent or, perhaps, there were none, for the scores of Gluck's _Alceste_ in Italian and Haydn's _Seasons_ were printed from type. However that may be the score of _Orfeo_ was engraved in Paris. The composer Philidor corrected the proofs. He little thought that _Orfeo_ would ever get so far as Paris, so he appropriated the romanza in the first act and introduced it with but slight modifications into his op\u00e9ra-comique _Le Sorcier_. Later on Marie Antoinette called Gluck to Paris and thus afforded him the opportunity for the complete development of his genius. After he had written _Iphigenie en Aulide_, performed in 1774, especially for the Op\u00e9ra, he had the idea of adapting _Orfeo_ for the French stage. To tell the truth he must have thought of it before, for _Orph\u00e9e_ appeared at the Op\u00e9ra only three months after _Iphigenie_ and it had been entirely rewritten in collaboration with Moline. The contralto part had been changed to tenor and so the principal r\u00f4le was given to Legros.", "While it may be true that the author improved this work in the French version, it is not true in every case. There is some question whether the overture existed in the Italian score. It is generally believed that it did, but there are old copies of this version in existence and they begin the opera with the funeral chorus and show no overture at all. This overture, although the _Mercure de France_ treats it as a \"beautiful symphonic piece which serves as a good introduction to the work,\" in reality does not resemble the style of the rest at all. It in no way prepares for that admirable chorus at the beginning--unequaled of its kind--which Orpheus's broken hearted cry of \"Eurydice! Eurydice!\" makes so pathetic.", "The first act of _Orfeo_ ends in a tumultuous effect of the stringed instruments which was evidently intended to indicate a change of scene and the appearance of the stage settings of the infernal regions. This passage does not appear in the French _Orph\u00e9e_ and it is lacking in the engraved score, where it is replaced by a bravura aria of doubtful taste, accompanied by a single quartet. Whether the stage managers wanted an entr'acte or the tenor, Legros, demanded an effective aria, or for both these reasons, a reading of the manuscript indicates how absolutely the author's meaning was changed. There is no doubt that except for some such reason he would have changed this aria and put it in harmony with the rest of the work.", "For a long time this aria was attributed to Bertoni, the composer, and Gluck was accused of plagiarizing it. As a matter of fact, and to the contrary, this aria came from an older Italian opera of Gluck's. Bertoni not only imitated it in one of his scores, but he had the hardihood to write an _Orfeo_ on the text already followed by Gluck in which he plagiarized the work of his illustrious predecessor in a scandalous fashion.", "This same aria, changed with real genius and performed with prodigious eclat by Madame Viardot, and re-orchestrated by myself, was one of the strongest reasons for the success of the famous performances at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Lyrique. But it is well understood that it could not properly find a place in an edition where the sole end was artistic sincerity and purity of the text.", "From this point of view it would seem that the best manner of giving _Orph\u00e9e_ would be to conform to the author's definitive version. A tenor would have to take the part of Orpheus, since we no longer have male contraltos, and to keep to this kind of a voice in _Orph\u00e9e_ we would have to have recourse to what is called, in theatrical terms, a _travesti_. There are obstacles to this, however. The pitch has changed since the Eighteenth Century; it has gone up and it is now impossible, or nearly so, to sing the r\u00f4le written for Legros. The contraltos of the Italian chorus have become the counter-tenors, who, for the same reason, find themselves struggling with too sharp notes.", "In the Seventeenth Century the French pitch was even more flat, and it is a great pity, for it is almost impossible to perform our old music, on account of the insuperable obstacles. This is not the case in Germany, however, or in Italy, and that is the reason why the works of Sebastian Bach and Mozart can be sung. The same is true of Gluck's Italian works.", "This was the reason that Doret gave the part of Orpheus to a contralto, just as is done at the Op\u00e9ra-Comique. The poetic character of the part of Orpheus lends itself excellently to such a feminine interpretation. But in resuming the key of the Italian score, it is necessary to go back, at least to a considerable degree, to the instrumentation. By a curious anomaly the beautiful recitative, accompanied by the murmur of brooks and the songs of the birds, is in C major in both scores. The author could not have changed them. On the contrary he modified his instrumentation greatly, simplified and perfected it.", "We know that the authors, in utter defiance of mythology, wanted a happy ending and so brought Eurydice back to life a second time. Love accomplished this miracle and the work ended with the song \"Love Triumphs,\" which is exceedingly joyful and in harmony with the situation. They did not want this ending, which was in _Orfeo_ and which Gluck retained in _Orph\u00e9e_, at the old Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Lyrique and the Op\u00e9ra-Comique, and they replaced it with a chorus by Echo and Narcissus. This chorus is charming, but that does not excuse it. Joy was what the author wanted and this does not give joy at all. Gluck's finale is regarded as not sufficiently distinguished, but this is wrong. The real finale was sung at M\u00e9zi\u00e8res and it was found that it was not at all common, but that its frank gaiety was in the best of taste.", "Gluck had no scruples about grinding several grists from the same sack and drawing from his old works to help out his new ones. So the parasitical aria attributed to Bertoni was written by Gluck in the first place in 1764 for a soprano. He wove this into his opera _Aristo_ in 1769. This is also true of the trio, _Tendre Amour_, which precedes the finale in the last act. A serious-minded analyst might be tempted to admire the profound psychology of the author in mingling doleful accents with expressions of joy, but he would have his labor for his pains. The trio was taken from the opera _Elena e Paride_, where Gluck expressed strongly wrought up emotions. Doret did not keep these two passages and one can't blame him. On the other hand, he retained, by making it an entr'acte, the _Ballet des Furies_. This was taken from a ballet, _Don Giovanni o il convitato de pietra_, which was performed at Vienna in 1761. This passage was used as the accompaniment to Don Juan's descent into Hell, surrounded by his band of demons.", "Many of Gluck's compatriots came to M\u00e9zi\u00e8res to see _Orph\u00e9e_ and they were loyal enough to recognize the superiority of the performance. Some even had the courage to say, \"We murder Gluck in Germany.\"", "I discovered that fact a long time ago. In my youth I was indignant when I saw Paris, where Gluck wrote his finest works, quite neglecting them, whereas Germany continued to promote them. In those days I was frequently called to the other side of the Rhine to play in concerts, and I watched for a chance to see one of these masterpieces which had been forgotten in France. So it was with the liveliest joy that one day I entered one of the leading German theaters where they were giving _Armide_. What a hollow mockery it was!", "Madame Malten was Armide, and she was everything that could be wished in voice, talent, style, beauty and charm. She spoke French without an accent and was as remarkable as an actress as a singer, so she would without doubt have had great success at the Op\u00e9ra in Paris. She was Armide herself, an irresistible enchantress.", "But the rest! Renaud was a raw boy, and his shaven chin brought out in sharp relief enormous black moustaches with long waxed ends. He had a voice, to be sure, but no style, and no understanding of the work he was trying to interpret.", "\"I see hard by Death that threatens me, And already old age, that has chilled my blood, Is on me, bowing me beneath a crushing burden.\"", "Imagine my surprise at seeing come on the stage a magnificent specimen of manhood, with a curled black beard, in all the glory of his youth and vigor superbly arrayed in a red cloak trimmed with gold!", "The stage setting was also extraordinary. In the second act Renaud went to sleep at the back of the stage, forcing Armide to speak the whole of the beautiful scene which follows, one of the most important in the part, at a distance from the footlights and with her back to the audience.", "As for the orchestra, sometimes it followed Gluck's text and sometimes it borrowed bits of orchestration which Meyerbeer had written for the Op\u00e9ra at Berlin. This orchestration is interesting, and I know it well for I have had it in hand. It is only fair to say that Gluck, from some inexplicable caprice, did not give the same care to the instrumentation of _Armide_ that he did to _Orph\u00e9e_, _Alcesti_, and the _Iphigenies_. The trombones do not appear at all and the drums and flutes only at rare intervals. Re-orchestration is not absolutely necessary and Meyerbeer's is no more reprehensible than those with which Mozart enriched Handel's _Messe_ and _La F\u00eate d'Alexandre_. What was inadmissible was not deciding frankly for one version or the other. It was like a badly patched coat which shows the old cloth in one place and the new in another.", "Did you ever happen to cherish the memory of a delightful and picturesque city, where everything made a harmonious whole, where the beautiful walks were arched over by old trees--and later come back to it to find it embellished, the trees cut down, the walks replaced by enormous buildings which dwarfed into insignificance the ancient marvels which gave the city its charm?", "This was the case with me when I saw _Armide_ again in a city which I shall not name. The opera had been judged superannuated and had been \"improved.\" A young composer had written a new score in which he inserted here and there such bits of Gluck as he thought worthy of being preserved. A costly and magnificently imbecile luxuriousness set off the whole piece. I may be pardoned the cruel adjective when I say that in the scene of Hate, so deeply inspired, and which takes place in a sort of cave, they relegated the chorus to the wings to make a place for dragons, fantastic birds beating their wings, and other deviltries. This, of course, deprived the chorus of all its power and distinction.", "But the best was at the end of the second act. The forest with its trees, grass and rocks entirely disappeared in the flies taking Renaud and Armide with it and the spectator was left, for some unknown reason, looking at a background surrounded by mountains. Then, by a marvel of mechanism, there appeared to the sound of ultramodern music, Renaud sleeping on a bed of state, with Armide standing at the foot and stretching forth her hand with a gesture of authority, declaiming in a solemn tone,", "We owe much to Germany in music, for it has produced many great musicians. It can set off against our trinity of Corneille, Racine, and Moli\u00e8re, the no less glorious Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven. But Germany seems to have lost all respect for the meaning of its own music and for its own glories. Instead of watching over the purity of the text of its masterpieces, it alters them at its pleasure and makes them all but unrecognizable. We abuse nuances but they were rare in earlier days. An orchestra conductor who performs symphonies by Haydn and Mozart, even by Beethoven, has the right to make additions. But it is intolerable that the scores should be printed with these nuances and bowings which are in no way due to the author and which are imposed by the editor. Nevertheless, that is what happens, and it is impossible to tell where the authentic text ends and the interpolation begins. In addition, the interpolation may be the exact contrary of what the author intended.", "This evil is at its worst in piano music. Our famous teachers, like Marmontel and Le Couppey, have published editions of the classics which are full of their own directions. But the player is forewarned; it is the Marmontel or Le Couppey edition and makes no pretence of authenticity. In Germany, however, there are supposedly authentic editions, based on the originals, but which superimpose their own pernicious inventions on the author's text.", "The touch of the piano used to be different from what it is to-day. The directions in Mozart's and Beethoven's works show that they used the execution of stringed instruments as their model. The touch was lighter and the fingers were raised so that the notes were separated slightly, and not run together except when indicated. The supposition is that this must have led to a dryness of tone. I remember to have heard in my childhood some old people whose playing was singularly hopping. Then, there came a reaction, and with it a passion for slurring the notes. When I was Stamaty's pupil, it was considered most difficult to \"tie\" the notes; that required, however, only dexterity and suppleness. \"When she learns to 'tie,' she will know how to play,\" said the mother of a young pianist. Nevertheless, the trick of perpetual _legato_ becomes exceedingly monotonous and takes away all character from the pianoforte classics. But it is insisted on everywhere in the modern German editions. Throughout there are connections seemingly interminable in length, and indications of _legato_, _sempre legato_, which the author not only did not indicate, but in places where it is easy to see that he intended the exact opposite.", "If this is the case, what shall be said of marking the fingering on all the notes--which often makes good playing impossible. Liszt taught hundreds of pupils according to the best principles, yet such erroneous principles have prevailed!", "Disciples of the ivory keys are numerous in our day. Everybody wants to have a piano, and everybody plays it or thinks he does, which is not always the same thing, and few really understand what the term \"to play the piano,\" so currently used, means.", "The harpsichord reigned supreme before the appearance of the piano--an instrument which is beloved by some and execrated by others. To his utter amazement Reyer was considered an enemy of the pianoforte. The harpsichord has been revived of late so that it is needless to describe it. It lacks strength, and that was the reason it was dethroned in a period when strength was everything. On the other hand, it has distinction and elegance. As the player can not modify the intensity of the sound by a single pressure of the finger--in which it resembles the organ--like the organ, with its multiple keyboards and registers, the harpsichord has a wide variety of effects and affords the opportunity for several octaves to sound simultaneously. As a result, while music written for the harpsichord gains in strength and expression on the modern instrument, it often assumes a deceptive monotony for which the author is not responsible.", "The players of the harpsichord were ignorant of muscular effects; there was nothing of the unchained lion about them. The delicate hands of a marquise lost none of their gracefulness as they skimmed over the keyboards, and the red or black keys emphasized their whiteness.", "The introduction of the hammer in the place of the tiny nib permitted the modification of the quality of sound by differences in the pressure of the fingers, and also the production at will of such nuances as _forte_ and _piano_ without recourse to the different registers. This is the reason why the new instrument was first called the pianoforte. The word was long and cumbersome and was cut in half. When it became necessary to _assault_ the note, they used the phrase \"to hit the forte.\" The papers which gave accounts of young Mozart's concerts praised him for his ability to \"hit.\"", "Nevertheless one did not hit hard. These keyboards with their limited keys responded so easily that a child's fingers were sufficient. I first played on one of these instruments at the age of three. It was made by Zimmerman, whose son was Gounod's father-in-law.", "Later, the weight of the keys was increased to get a greater volume of sound. Then, when long-haired _virtuosi_, playing by main strength, produced peals of thunder, they really \"_toucha du piano_.\"", "To return to _Orph\u00e9e_ and end as we began, I have to make a painful confession. If the works of Gluck in general and _Orph\u00e9e_ in particular have had a happy influence on our musical taste, a passage from this last work has been a noxious influence,--the famous chorus of the demons \"_Quel est l'audacieux--qui dans ces sombres lieux--ose porter ses pas?_\"", "In the old days French opera was based on declamation and it was scrupulously respected even in the arias. There is a fine example of this excellent system in Lully's famous aria from _Medusa_ to prove what strength results from a close relation between the accent of the verse and the music. Gluck was one of the most fervent disciples of this system, but _Orph\u00e9e_, as we know, was derived from _Orfeo_. The question was whether he could even think of suppressing this spectacular chorus with its amazing strength which was one of the principal reasons for the work's success. Unfortunately the music of the chorus was moulded on the Italian text, and each verse ended with the accent on the antepenult, which occurs frequently in German and Italian, but never in French. And they sing:", "As French is not strongly accented such faults are tolerated. Gluck's theme impressed itself on the memory, so that he dealt a terrific blow to the purity of prosody. We gradually became so disinterested in this that by Auber's time scarcely any attention was paid to it. Finally, Offenbach appeared. He was a German by birth and his musical ideas naturally rhymed with German in direct contradiction to the French words to which they applied. This constant bungling passed for originality. Sometimes it would have been necessary to change the division of a measure to get a correct melody, as in the song:", "In such a case we might say that he did wrong for the mere pleasure of going astray. But popular taste was so corrupted that no one noticed it and everybody who wrote in the lighter vein fell into the same habits.", "We owe a debt of gratitude to Andr\u00e9 Messager for breaking away from this manner and setting musical phraseology aright. His return to the old traditions was not the least of the attractions of his delightful _V\u00e9ronique_.", "But we are wandering far from Gluck and _Orph\u00e9e_, although not so far as we might think. In art, as in everything, extremes meet, and there are all kinds of tastes.", "Felix Duquesnal in one of his brilliant articles has written something about Delsarte, the singer, in connection with his controversy with Madame Carvalho. The cause of this controversy was the lessons she took from him. The name of Delsarte should never be forgotten, as I shall try to explain. Madame Carvalho did not refuse to pay Delsarte for her lessons, but she did not want to be called his pupil. Although she had attended the Conservatoire, she wanted to be known solely as a pupil of Duprez. As a matter of fact it was Duprez who knew how to make the \"Little Miolan,\" the delightful warbler, into the great singer with her important place on the French stage.", "But this was accomplished at a price. Madame Carvalho told me about it herself. Her medium register was weak and Duprez undertook to substitute chest tones and develop clearness as much as possible. \"When I began to work,\" she said, \"my mother was frightened. One would have thought that a calf was being killed in the house.\"", "Ordinarily such a method would produce a harsh, shaky voice and all freshness would be lost. But in Madame Carvalho's case the opposite was true. The freshness and purity of her voice were beyond compare, while its smoothness and the harmony of the registers were perfect. It was a miracle the like of which we shall probably never see again.", "But if Duprez made a wonderful voice at the risk of breaking it, I have always thought that Madame Carvalho owed her admirable diction, so distinguishing a mark of her talent, to Delsarte. Delsarte was a disastrous and deadly teacher of singing. No voice could stand up under his methods, not even his own, although he attributed its loss to teaching at the Conservatoire. But he studied deeply the arts of speaking and gesture, and he was a past master in them.", "I once attended a course he gave in these subjects. He stated highly illuminating truths and gave the psychological reasons for accents and the physiological reasons for the gestures. He determined the use of gestures in some sort of scientific way. Mystic fancies were mixed up in these questions.", "It was extremely interesting to see him dissect one of Fontaine's fables or a passage from Racine, and to hear him explain why the accent should be on such a word or on such a syllable and not on another, to bring out the sense. Although this course was so instructive, few took it, for Delsarte was almost unknown to people. His influence scarcely extended outside a narrow circle of admirers, but the quality made up for the quantity. This was the circle of the old _Debats_, which was formerly devoted exclusively to Romanticism, but at this time to the classics--the set headed by Ingres in painting and Reber in music. Theirs was a secluded and ascetic world in silent revolt against the abominations of the century. One had to hear the tone of devotion in which the members of this circle spoke of the ancients to appreciate their attitude. Nothing in our day can give any idea of them. \"They say,\" one of the devotees once told me, \"that the ancients learned Beauty through a sort of revelation, and Beauty has steadily degenerated ever since.\"", "Such false notions were, however, professed by the most sincere people who were deeply devoted to art. So this group, which had no influence on their own contemporaries, nevertheless, without knowing it or wishing to do so, played a useful r\u00f4le.", "As we know, the public was divided into two camps. On one side were the partisans of Melody, op\u00e9ra-comique, the Italians, and, with some effort, of grand opera. Opposed to them were the partisans of music in the grand style--Beethoven, Mozart, Haydn, and Sebastian Bach, although he was little known and is less well known now.", "No one gave a thought to our old French school, to the composers from Lulli to Gluck, who produced so many excellent works. Reber showed Delsarte the way and the latter, naturally an antiquarian, threw himself into this unexplored field with surprising vigor. Only Lulli's name was known, while Campra, Mondonville and the others were entirely forgotten. Even Gluck himself had been forgotten. First editions of his orchestral scores, which it is impossible to find to-day, sold for a few francs at the second-hand book shops. Rameau was never mentioned.", "Delsarte, handsome, eloquent, and fascinating, wielded an almost imperial sway over his little coterie of artists. Thanks to him the lamp of our old French school was kept dimly burning until the day when inherent justice permitted it to be revived. In this restricted world no evening was complete without Delsarte. He would come in with some story of frightful throat trouble to justify his chronic lack of voice, and, then, without any voice at all but by a kind of magic, would put shudders into the tones of Orpheus or Eurydice. I often played his accompaniments and he always demanded _pianissimo_.", "It would have been easy to answer that the accompaniment was written for the orchestra and not for the harpsichord.", "Delsarte's execution, on account of the insufficiency of his vocal powers, was often entirely different from what the author intended. Furthermore, he was absolutely ignorant of the correct way to interpret the appogiatures and other marks which are not used to-day. As a result his interpretation of the older works was inexact. But that did not matter, for even if masterpieces are presented badly, there is always something left. Besides, both the singer and his hearers had Faith. He had a way of pronouncing \"Gluck\" which aroused expectation even before one heard a note.", "From time to time Delsarte gave a concert. He would come on the stage and say that he had a bad throat, but that he would try to give _Iphigenia's Dream_ or something of that sort. His courage would prove to be greater than his strength and he would have to stop. He would then fall back on old-time songs or La Fontaine's fables in which he excelled. A skilfully studied mimicry, which seemed entirely natural, underlay his reading. A red handkerchief, which he knew how to draw from his pocket at just the proper moment, always excited applause.", "One day he conceived the idea of giving one of Bossuet's sermons at his concert. Religious authority was very powerful at the time and forbade it. Yet there would have been no sacrilege, and I regretted keenly that I could not hear this magnificent prose delivered so wonderfully. Now that religious authority has lost its secular support, we see things in an entirely different way. Christ, the Virgin, and the Saints walk the stage, speak in prose or verse, and sing. It would seem that no one is shocked for there is no protest. For my own part I must frankly confess that such pseudo-religious exhibitions are disagreeable. They disturb me greatly and I can see no use in them.", "In order to foster admiration for the old masters, Delsarte conceived the idea of publishing a collection of pieces taken from their works right and left, and, as a result, he created his _Archives du Chant_. He had special type made and the publication was a marvel of beautiful typography, correctness and good taste. At the beginning of each part was a cleverly harmonised passage of church music. The support of a publisher was necessary for the success of such a work, but Delsarte was his own publisher and he met with no success at all. Similar but inferior publications have been markedly successful.", "Delsarte aimed at purity of text, but his successors have been forced to modernize the works to make them accessible for the public. This fact is painful. In literature the texts are studied and the endeavor is to reproduce the writer's thought as closely as possible. In music it is entirely different. With each new edition a professor is commissioned to supervise the work and he adds something of his own invention.", "Delsarte, a singer without a voice, an imperfect musician, a doubtful scholar, guided by an intuition which approached genius, in spite of his numerous faults played an important r\u00f4le in the evolution of French music in the Nineteenth Century. He was no ordinary man. The impression he gave to all who knew him was of a visionary, an apostle. When one heard him speak with his fiery enthusiasm about these works of the past which the world had forgotten, one could but believe that such oblivion was unjust and desire to know these relics of another age.", "Without the shadow of a doubt I owed to his leadership the necessary courage to make a profound study of the works of the old school, for they are unattractive at first. Berlioz berated all this music. He had seen Gluck's works on the stage in his youth, but he could see nothing in them that was not \"superannuated and childish.\" With all respect to Berlioz's memory, it deserved a kinder judgment than that. When one reaches the depths of this music, although it may be at the price of some effort, he is well repaid for his pains. There is real feeling, grandeur and even something of the picturesque in these works--as much as could be with the means at their disposal.", "It is only right that we should pay tribute to Delsarte's memory. He was a pioneer who, during his whole life, proclaimed the value of immortal works, which the world despised. That is no slight merit.", "While Delsarte was preparing the way for the old French opera and above all for Gluck's works, another pioneer of musical evolution was working to form the taste of the Parisian public, but with an entirely different power and another effect. Seghers was the man. He played a great r\u00f4le and his memory should be honored.", "As his name indicates, Seghers was a Belgian. He started life as a violinist and was one of Baillot's pupils. His execution was masterly, his tone admirable, and he had a musical intelligence of the first order. He had every right to a first rank among _virtuosi_, but this man, herculean in appearance and tenacious in his purposes, lost all his power before an audience.", "He had a dream of giving to lovers of music the last of Beethoven's quartets, which were considered at the time both unplayable and incomprehensible. In the end he planned a series of concerts at which, despite my age--I was only fifteen--I was to be the regular pianist. He planned to give in addition to these quartets, some of Bach's sonatas and Reber's and Schumann's trios. I spoke of this plan to his mother-in-law one day as she was peacefully embroidering at the window, and told her how pleased I was at the thought of the concerts.", "When everything was ready, he invited some thirty people to listen to a trial performance. It was wretched. All the depth of tone had gone from his violin as well as the skill from his fingers.... The project was abandoned.", "It was left for Maurin to make something out of these terrible quartets. Maurin had peculiar gifts. He had a lightness of bow which I have never seen equalled by anyone and a lightness and charm which enchanted the public. But I can say in all sincerity that Seghers's execution was even better. Unfortunately for him I was his only listener.", "Madame Seghers was a woman of great beauty, unusually intelligent and distinguished. She had been one of Liszt's pupils and was a pianist of first rank. But she was even more timid than her husband--a single listener was sufficient to paralyze her. When Liszt was teaching Madame Seghers, he came to appreciate her husband's real worth and entrusted his daughter's musical education to him. This is sufficient indication of the esteem in which Liszt held Seghers. So it was not surprising that he gave me valuable and greatly needed suggestions in regard to style and the piano itself, for his friendship with Liszt had given him a thorough understanding of the instrument.", "I first saw and heard Liszt at Seghers's house. He had reappeared in Paris after long years of absence, and by that time he had begun to seem almost legendary. The story went that since he had become chapel-master at Weimar he was devoting himself to grand compositions, and, what appeared unbelievable, \"piano music.\" People who ought to have known that Mozart was the greatest pianist of his time shrugged their shoulders at this. As a climax it was insinuated that Liszt was setting systems of philosophy to music.", "I studied Liszt's works with all the enthusiasm of my eighteen years for I already regarded him as a genius and attributed to him even before I saw him almost superhuman powers as a pianist. Remarkable to relate he surpassed the conception I had formed. The dreams of my youthful imagination were but prose in comparison with the Bacchic hymn evoked by his supernatural fingers. No one who did not hear him at the height of his powers can have any idea of his performance.", "Seghers was a member of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Concerts at the Conservatoire. This reached only a restricted public and there was no other symphony concert worthy of the name in Paris at the time. And if the public was limited, the repertoire was even more so. Haydn's, Mozart's and Beethoven's symphonies were played almost exclusively, and Mendelssohn's were introduced with the greatest difficulty. Only fragments of vast compositions like the oratorios were given. An author who was still alive was looked upon as an intruder. However, the conductor was permitted to introduce a solo of his own selection. Thus my friend Auguste Tolbecque, who was over eighty, was permitted to give--he still played beautifully--my first _concerto_ for the violoncello which I had written for him. Deldevez, the conductor of the famous orchestra at the time, did not overlook the chance to tell me that he had put my _concerto_ on the programme only through consideration for Tolbecque. Otherwise, he added, he would have preferred Messieurs So-and-so's.", "Not only did the Conservatoire audiences know little music, but the larger public knew none at all. The symphonies of the three great classic masters were known to amateurs for the most part only through Czerny's arrangement for two pianos.", "This was the situation when Seghers left the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Concerts and founded the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 St. C\u00e9cile. He led the orchestra himself. The new society took its name from the St. C\u00e9cile hall which was then in the Rue de la Chauss\u00e9e d'Antin. It was a large square hall and was excellent in spite of the prejudice in favor of halls with curved lines for music. Curved surfaces, as Cavaill\u00e9-Coll, who was an expert in this matter, once told me, distort sound as curved mirrors distort images. Halls used for music should, therefore, have only straight lines. The St. C\u00e9cile hall was sufficiently large to allow a complete orchestra and chorus to be placed properly and heard as well.", "Seghers managed to assemble an excellent and sizable orchestra and he also secured soloists who were young then but who have since become celebrities. The orchestra was poorly paid and also very unruly. I have seen them rebel at the difficulties in Beethoven, and it was even worse when Seghers undertook to give Schumann who was considered the _ne plus ultra_ of modernism. Oftentimes there were real riots. But we heard there for the first time the overture of _Manfred_, Mendelssohn's _Symphony in A minor_, and the overture to _Tannhauser_.", "The modern French school found the doors in the Rue Berg\u00e8re closed to them, but they were welcomed with open arms at the Chauss\u00e9e d'Antin. Among them were Reber, Gounod, and Gouvy, and even beginners like Georges Bizet and myself. I made my first venture there with my _Symphony in E flat_ which I wrote when I was seventeen. In order to get the committee to adopt it, Seghers offered it as a symphony by an unknown author, which had been sent to him from Germany. The committees swallowed the bait, and the symphony, which would probably not had a hearing if my name had been signed, was praised to the skies.", "I can still see myself at a rehearsal listening to a conversation between Berlioz and Gounod. Both of them were greatly interested in me, so that they spoke freely and discussed the excellences and faults of this anonymous symphony. They took the work seriously and it can be imagined how I drank in their words. When the veil of mystery was lifted, the interest of the two great musicians changed to friendship. I received a letter from Gounod, which I have kept carefully, and as it does credit to the author, I take the liberty of reproducing it here:", "I was officially informed yesterday that you are the author of the symphony which they played on Sunday. I suspected it; but now that I am sure, I want to tell you at once how pleased I was with it. You are beyond your years; always keep on--and remember that on Sunday, December 11, 1853, you obligated yourself to become a great master.", "Many works which had been unknown to Parisian audiences were given at these concerts and nowhere else. Among them were Schubert's _Symphony in C,_ fragments of Weber's opera _Pr\u00e9ciosa,_ his _Jubel overture_, and symphonies by Gade, Gouvy, Gounod, and Reber. These symphonies are not dazzling but they are charming. They form an interesting link in the golden chain, and the public has a right and even some sort of duty to hear them. They would enjoy hearing them too, just as at the Louvre they like to see certain pictures which are not extraordinary but which are, nevertheless, worthy of the place they occupy. That is to say, if the public is really guided by a love of art and seeks only intellectual pleasure instead of sensations and shocks. Some one has said lately that where there is no feeling there is no music. We could, however, cite many passages of music which are absolutely lacking in emotion and which are beautiful nevertheless from the standpoint of pure esthetic beauty. But what am I saying? Painting goes its own way and emotion, feeling, and passion are evoked by the least landscape. Maurice Barres brought in this fashion and he could even see passion in rocks. Happy is he who can follow him there.", "Among the things we heard at that time and which we never hear now I must note especially Berlioz's _Corsaire_ and _King Lear_. His name is so much beloved by the present day public that this neglect is both unjust and unjustifiable. The great man himself came to the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 St. C\u00e9cile one day to conduct his _L'Enfance du Christ_ which he had just written--or rather _La Fuite en Egypt_ which was the only part of the work that was in existence then. He composed the rest of it afterwards. I remember perfectly the performances which the great man directed. They were lively and spirited rather than careful, but somewhat slower than what Edouard Colonne has accustomed us to. The time was faster and the nuances sharper.", "In spite of the enthusiasm of the conductor and the skill and talent of the orchestra, the society led a hand-to-mouth existence. The sinews of war were lacking. Weckerlin directed the choruses and I acted as the accompanist at the rehearsals. Love of art sufficed us, but the singers and instrumentalists were not satisfied with that in the absence of all emoluments. If Seghers had been adaptable, he might have secured resources, but that was not his forte. Meyerbeer wanted him to give his _Struens\u00e9e_ and Hal\u00e9vy wanted a performance of his _Prom\u00e9th\u00e9e_. But this was contrary to Seghers's convictions, and when he had once made up his mind nothing could change him. Nevertheless he did give the overture to _Struens\u00e9e_ and it would have been no great effort to give the rest. As to _Prom\u00e9th\u00e9e_, even if the last part is not in harmony with the rest of it, the work was well worthy the honor of a performance, which the proud society in the Rue Berg\u00e8re had accorded it. By these refusals Seghers was deprived of the support of two powerful protectors.", "Pasdeloup craftily took advantage of the situation. He had plenty of money and, as he knew what the financial situation was, he went to the rehearsals and corrupted the artists. For the most part they were young people in needy circumstances and could not refuse his attractive propositions. He killed Seghers's society and built on its ruins the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Jeunes Artistes, which later became the Concerts Populaires.", "Pasdeloup was sincerely fond of music but he was a very ordinary musician. He had little of Seghers's feeling and profound comprehension of the art. In Seghers's hands the popular concerts would have become an admirable undertaking, but Pasdeloup, in spite of his zeal and skill, was able to give them only a superficial and deceptive brilliancy. Besides, Seghers would have worked for the development of the French school whom Pasdeloup, with but few exceptions, kept under a bushel until 1870. Among these exceptions were a symphony by Gounod, one by Gouvy and the overture to Berlioz's _Frances-Juges._ Until the misfortunes and calamities of that terrible year the French symphonic school had been repressed and stifled between the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Concerts and the Concerts Populaires. Perhaps they were necessary so that this school might be freed and give flight to its fancies.", "Nowadays it is difficult to form any idea of Rossini's position in our beautiful city of Paris half a century ago. He had retired from active life a long time before, but he had a greater reputation in his idleness than many others in their activity. All Paris sought the honor of being admitted to his magnificent, high-windowed apartment. As the demigod never went out in the evening, his friends were always sure of finding him at home. At one time or another all sorts of social sets rubbed elbows at his great soirees. The most brilliant singers and the most famous virtuosi appeared at these \"evenings.\" The master was surrounded by sycophants, but they did not influence him, for he knew their true worth. He ruled his regular following with the hauteur of a superior being who does not deign to reveal himself to the first comer. It is a question how he came to be held in such honor.", "His works, outside of the _Barbier_ and _Guillaume Tell_, and some performances of _Mo\u00efse_, belonged to the past. They still went to see _Otello_ at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Italien, but that was to hear Tamberlick's C diesis. Rossini was under so little illusion that he tried to oppose the effort to have _Semiramide_ put into the repertoire at the Op\u00e9ra. And, nevertheless, the Parisian public actually worshipped him.", "This public--I am speaking now of the musical public or what is called that--was divided into two hostile camps. There were the lovers of melody who were in the large majority and included the musical critics; and, on the other side, the subscribers to the Conservatoire and the Maurin, Alard and Amingaud quartets. They were devotees of learned music; \"poseurs,\" others said, who pretended to admire works they did not understand at all.", "There was no melody in Beethoven; some even denied that there was any in Mozart. Melody was found, we were told, only in the works of the Italian school, of which Rossini was the leader, and in the school of Herold and Auber, which was descended from the Italian.", "The Melodists considered Rossini their standard bearer, a symbol to rally around, even though they had just obtained good prices for his works at the second-hand shops and now permitted them to fall into oblivion.", "From some words he let fall during our intimacy I can state that this neglect was painful to him. But it was a just--perhaps too just--retribution for the fatality with which Rossini, doubtless in spite of himself, served as a weapon against Beethoven. The first encounter was at Vienna where the success of _Tancred_ crushed forever the dramatic ambitions of the author of _Fidelio_; later, at Paris, they used _Guillaume Tell_ in combating the increasing invasion of the symphony and chamber music.", "I was twenty when M. and Mme. Viardot introduced me to Rossini. He invited me to his small evening receptions and received me with his usual rather meaningless cordiality. At the end of a month, when he found that I asked to be heard neither as a pianist nor as a composer, he changed his attitude. \"Come and see me tomorrow morning,\" he said. \"We can talk then.\"", "I was quick to respond to this flattering invitation and I found a very different Rossini from the one of the evening. He was intensely interested in and open-minded to ideas, which, if they were not advanced, were at least broad and noble. He gave proof of this when Liszt's famous _Messe_ was performed for the first time at St. Eustache. He went to its defense in the face of an almost unanimous opposition.", "\"You have written a duet for a flute and clarinet for Dorus and Leroy. Won't you ask them to play it at one of my evenings?\"", "The two great artists did not have to be urged. Then an unheard of thing happened. As he never had a written programme on such occasions, Rossini managed so that they believed that the duet was his own. It is easy to imagine the success of the piece under these conditions. When the encore was over, Rossini took me to the dining-room and made me sit near him, holding me by the hand so that I could not get away. A procession of fawning admirers passed in front of him. Ah! Master! What a masterpiece! Marvellous!", "Such kindness combined with such ingenuity tells more about the great man than many volumes of commentaries. For Rossini was a great man. The young people of to-day are in no position to judge his works, which were written, as he said himself, for singers and a public who no longer exist.", "\"I am criticised,\" he said one day, \"for the great _crescendo_ in my works. But if I hadn't put the _crescendo_ into my works, they would never have been played at the Op\u00e9ra.\"", "In our day the public are slaves. I have read in the programme of one house, \"All marks of approbation will be severely repressed.\" Formerly, especially in Italy, the public was master and its taste law. As it came before the lights were up, a great overture with a _crescendo_ was as necessary as cavatinas, duets and ensembles: they came to hear the singers and not to be present at an opera. In many of his works, especially in _Otello_, Rossini made a great step forward towards realism in opera. In _Mo\u00efse_ and _Le Si\u00e8ge de Corinthe_ (not to mention _Guillaume Tell_) he rose to heights which have not been surpassed in spite of the poverty of the means at his disposal. As Victor Hugo has victoriously demonstrated, such poverty is no obstacle to genius and wealth in them is only an advantage to mediocrity.", "I was one of the regular pianists at Rossini's. The others were Stanzieri, a charming young man of whom Rossini was very fond and who lived but a short time, and Diemer, who was also young but already a great artist. One or the other of us would often play at the evening entertainments the slight pieces for the piano which the Master used to write to take up his time. I was only too willing to accompany the singers, when Rossini did not do so himself. He accompanied them admirably for he played the piano to perfection.", "Unfortunately I was not there the evening that Patti sang for Rossini the first time. We know that after she had sung the aria from _Le Barbier_, he said to her, after the usual compliments,", "\"I am fully aware,\" he said, \"that arias should be embellished. That's what they are for. But not to leave a note of them even in the recitatives! That is too much!\"", "In his irritation he complained that the sopranos persisted in singing this aria which was written for a contralto and did not sing what had been written for the sopranos at all.", "On the other hand the diva was irritated as well. She thought the matter over and realized that it would be serious to have Rossini for an enemy. So some days later she went to ask his advice. It was well for her that she took it, for her talent, though brilliant and fascinating, was not as yet fully formed. Two months after this incident, Patti sang the arias from _La Gaza Ladra_ and _Semiramide_, with the master as her accompanist. And she combined with her brilliancy the absolute correctness which she always showed afterwards.", "Much has been written about the premature interruption of Rossini's career after the appearance of _Guillaume Tell_. It has been compared with Racine's life after _Ph\u00e8dre_. The failure of _Ph\u00e8dre_ was brutal and cruel, which was added to by the scandalous success of the _Ph\u00e8dre_ of an unworthy rival. Racine's friends, the Port Royalists, did not hesitate to make the most of the opportunity. \"You've lost your soul,\" they told him. \"And now you haven't even success.\" But later, when he took up his pen again, he gave us two masterpieces in _Esther_ and _Athalie_.", "Rossini was accustomed to success and it was hard for him to run into a half-hearted success when he knew he had surpassed himself. This was doubtless due to the extravagant phraseology of Hippolyte Bis, one of the librettists. But _Guillaume Tell_ had its admirers from the start. I heard it spoken of constantly in my childhood. If the work did not appear on the bills of the Op\u00e9ra, it furnished the amateurs with choice bits.", "In my opinion, if Rossini committed suicide as far as his art was concerned, he did so because he had nothing more to say. Rossini was a spoiled child of success and he could not live without it. Such unexpected hostility put an end to a stream which had flowed so abundantly for so long.", "The success of his _Soir\u00e9es Musicales_ and his _Stabat_ encouraged him. But he wrote nothing more except those slight compositions for the piano and for singing which may be compared to the last vibrations of a sound, as it dies away.", "Later--much later--came _La Messe_ to which undue importance has been attributed. \"_Le Passus_,\" one critic wrote, \"is the cry of a stricken spirit.\" La Messe is written with elegance by an assured and expert hand, but that is all. There are no traces of the pen which wrote the second act of _Guillaume Tell_.", "Apropos of this second act, it is not, perhaps, generally known that the author had no idea of ending it with a prayer. Insurrections are not usually begun with so serious a song. But at the rehearsals the effect of the unison, _Si parmi nous il est des Tra\u00eetres_, was so great that they did not dare to go on beyond it. So they suppressed the real ending, which is now the brilliant entrancing end of the overture. This finale is extant in the library at the Op\u00e9ra. It would be an interesting experiment to restore it and give this beautiful act its natural conclusion.", "Massenet has been praised indiscriminately--sometimes for his numerous and brilliant powers and sometimes for merits he did not have at all.", "I have waited to speak of him until the time when the Acad\u00e9mie was ready to replace him,--that is to say, put some one in his place, for great artists are never replaced. Others succeed them with their own individual and different powers, but they do not take their places nevertheless. Malibran has never been replaced, nor Madame Viardot, Madame Carvalho, Talma and Rachel. No one can ever replace Patti, Bartet or Sarah Bernhardt. They could not replace Ingres, Delacroix, Berlioz, or Gounod, and they can never replace Massenet.", "It is a question whether he has been accorded his real place. Perhaps his pupils have estimated him at his true worth, but they were grateful for his excellent teaching, and may be rightly suspected of partiality. Others have spoken slightingly of his works and they have applied to him by transposing the words of the celebrated dictum: _Saltavit et placuit_. He sang and wept, so they sought to deprecate him as if there were something reprehensible in an artist's pleasing the public. This notion might seem to have some basis in view of the taste that is affected to-day--a predilection for all that is shocking and displeasing in all the arts, including poetry. Sorci\u00e8res's epigram--the ugly is beautiful and the beautiful ugly--has become a programme. People are no longer content with merely admiring atrocities, they even speak with contempt of beauties hallowed by time and the admiration of centuries.", "The fact remains that Massenet is one of the most brilliant diamonds in our musical crown. No musician has enjoyed so much favor with the public save Auber, whom Massenet did not care for any more than he did for his school, but whom he resembled closely. They were alike in their facility, their amazing fertility, genius, gracefulness, and success. Both composed music which was agreeable to their contemporaries. Both were accused of pandering to their audiences. The answer to this is that both their audiences and the artists had the same tastes and so were in perfect accord.", "To-day the revolutionists are the only ones held in esteem by the critics. Well, it may be a fine thing to despise the mob, to struggle against the current, and to compel the mob by force of genius and energy to follow one despite their resistance. Yet one may be a great artist without doing that.", "There was nothing revolutionary about Sebastian Bach with his two hundred and fifty cantatas, which were performed as fast as they were written and which were constantly in demand for important occasions. Handel managed the theater where his operas were produced and his oratorios were sung, and they would have indubitably failed, if he had gone against the accustomed taste of his audiences. Haydn wrote to supply the music for Prince Esterhazy's chapel; Mozart was forced to write constantly, and Rossini worked for an intolerant public which would not have allowed one of his operas to be played, if the overture did not contain the great _crescendo_ for which he has been so reproached. These were none of them revolutionists, yet they were great musicians.", "Another criticism is made against Massenet. He was superficial, they say, and lacked depth. Depth, as we know, is very much the fashion.", "It is true that Massenet was not profound, but that is of little consequence. Just as there are many mansions in our Father's house, so there are many in Apollo's. Art is vast. The artist has a perfect right to descend to the nethermost depths and to enter into the inner secrets of the soul, but this right is not a duty.", "The artists of Ancient Greece, with all their marvellous works, were not profound. Their marble goddesses were beautiful, and beauty was sufficient.", "Our old-time sculptors--Clodion and Coysevox--were not profound; nor were Fragonard, La Tour, nor Marivaux, yet they brought honor to the French school.", "All have their value and all are necessary. The rose with its fresh color and its perfume, is, in its way, as precious as the sturdy oak. Art has a place for artists of all kinds, and no one should flatter himself that he is the only one who is capable of covering the entire field of art.", "Some, even in treating a familiar subject, have as much dignity as a Roman emperor on his golden throne, but Massenet did not belong to this type. He had charm, attraction and a passionateness that was feverish rather than deep. His melody was wavering and uncertain, oftentimes more a recitative than melody properly so called, and it was entirely his own. It lacks structure and style. Yet how can one resist when he hears Manon at the feet of Des Grieux in the sacristy of Saint-Sulpice, or help being stirred to the depths by such outpourings of love? One cannot reflect or analyze when moved in this way.", "After emotional art comes decadent art. But that is of little consequence. Decadence in art is often far from being artistic deterioration.", "Massenet's music has one great attraction for me and one that is rare in these days--it is gay. And gaiety is frowned upon in modern music. They criticise Haydn and Mozart for their gaiety, and turn away their faces in shame before the exuberant joyousness with which the _Ninth Symphony_ comes to its triumphal close. Long live gloom. Hurrah for boredom! So say our young people. They may live to regret, too late, the lost hours which they might have spent in gaiety.", "Massenet's facility was something prodigious. I have seen him sick in bed, in a most uncomfortable position, and still turning off pages of orchestration, which followed one another with disconcerting speed. Too often such facility engenders laziness, but in his case we know what an enormous amount of work he accomplished. He has been criticised as being too prolific. However, that is a quality which belongs only to a master. The artist who produces little may, if he has ability, be an interesting artist, but he will never be a great one.", "In this time of anarchy in art, when all he had to do to conciliate the hostile critics was to array himself with the _fauves_, Massenet set an example of impeccable writing. He knew how to combine modernism with respect for tradition, and he did this at a time when all he had to do was to trample tradition under foot and be proclaimed a genius. Master of his trade as few have ever been, alive to all its difficulties, possessing the most subtle secrets of its technique, he despised the contortions and exaggerations which simple minds confound with the science of music. He followed out the course he had set for himself without any concern for what they might say about him. He was able to adopt within reason the novelties from abroad and he was clever in assimilating them perfectly, yet he presented the spectacle of a thoroughly French artist whom neither the Lorelei of the Rhine nor the sirens of the Mediterranean could lead astray. He was a _virtuoso_ of the orchestra, yet he never sacrificed the voices for the instruments, nor did he sacrifice orchestral color for the voices. Finally, he had the greatest gift of all, that of life, a gift which cannot be defined, but which the public always recognizes and which assures the success of works far inferior to his.", "Much has been said about the friendship between us--a notion based solely on the demonstrations he showered on me in public--and in public alone. He might have had my friendship, if he had wanted it, and it would have been a devoted friendship, but he did not want it. He told--what I never told--how I got one of his works presented at Weimar, where _Samson_ had just been given. What he did not tell was the icy reception he gave me when I brought the news and when I expected an entirely different sort of a reception. From that day on I never intervened again, and I was content to rejoice in his success without expecting any reciprocity on his part, which I knew to be impossible after a confession he made to me one day. My friends and companions in arms were Bizet, Guiraud and Delibes; Massenet was a rival. His high opinion of me, therefore, was the more valuable when he did me the honor of recommending his pupils to study my works. I have brought up this question only to make clear that when I proclaim his great musical importance, I am guided solely by my artistic conscience and that my sincerity cannot be suspected. One word more. Massenet had many imitators; he never imitated anyone.", "Who would have predicted that the day would come when it would be necessary to come to the defense of the author of _Les Huguenots_ and _Le Proph\u00e8te,_ of the man who at one time dominated every stage in Europe by a leadership which was so extraordinary that it looked as though it would never end? I could cite many works in which all the composers of the past are praised without qualification, and Meyerbeer, alone, is accused of numerous faults. However, others have faults, too, and, as I have said elsewhere, but it will stand repeating, it is not the absence of defects but the presence of merits which makes works and men great. It is not always well to be without blemish. A too regular face or too pure a voice lacks expression. If there is no such thing as perfection in this world, it is doubtless because it is not needed.", "As I do not belong to that biased school which pretends to see Peter entirely white and Paul utterly black, I do not try to make myself think that the author of _Les Huguenots_ had no faults.", "The most serious, but the most excusable, is his contempt for prosody and his indifference to the verse entrusted to him. This fault is excusable for the French school of the time, heedless of tradition, set him a bad example. Rossini was, like Meyerbeer, a foreigner, but he was not affected in the same way. He even got fine effects through the combination of musical and textual rhythm. An instance of this is seen in the famous phrase in _Guillaume Tell_:", "If Rossini had not retired at an age when others are just beginning their careers and had given us two or three more works, his illustrious example would have restored the old principles on which French opera had been constructed from the time of Lulli. On the contrary, Auber carried with him an entire generation captivated by Italian music. He even went so far as to put French words into Italian rhythm. The famous duet _Amour sacr\u00e9 de la Patrie_ is versified as if the text were _Amore sacro della patria._ This is seen only in reading it, for it is never sung as it is written.", "Meyerbeer was, then, excusable to a certain extent, but he abused all indulgence in such matters. In order to preserve intact his musical forms--even in recitatives, which are, as a matter of fact, only declamation set to music--he accented the weak syllables and vice versa; he added words and made unnecessarily false verse, and transformed bad verse into worse prose. He might have avoided all these literary abominations without any harm to the effect by a slight modification of the music. The verses given to musicians were often very bad, for that was the fashion. The versifier thought he had done his duty by his collaborator by giving him verses like this:", "Meyerbeer had other manias as well. Perhaps the most notable was to give to the voice musical schemes which belong by rights to the instruments. So in the first act of _Le Proph\u00e8te,_ after the chorus sings, _Veille sur nous,_ instead of stopping to breathe and prepare for the following phrase, he makes it repeat abruptly, _Sur nous! Sur nous!_ in unison with the orchestral notes which are, to say the least, _a ritornello._", "Again, in the great cathedral scene, instead of letting the orchestra bring out through the voices the musical expression of Fid\u00e8s sobs: _Et toi, tu ne me connais pas,_ he puts both the instruments and the voices in the same time and on words which do not harmonize with the music at all.", "I need not speak of his immoderate love for the bassoon, an admirable instrument, but one which it is hardly prudent to abuse.", "But so far we have spoken only of trifles. Meyerbeer's music, as a witty woman once remarked to me, is like stage scenery--it should not be scrutinized too closely. It would be hard to find a better characterization. Meyerbeer belonged to the theater and sought above everything else theatrical effects. But that does not mean that he was indifferent to details. He was a wealthy man and he used to indemnify the theaters for the extra expense he occasioned them. He multiplied rehearsals by trying different versions with the orchestra so as to choose between them. He did not cast his work in bronze, as so many do, and present it to the public _ne varietur._ He was continually feeling his way, recasting, and seeking the better which very often was the enemy of good. As the result of his continual researches he too frequently turned good ideas into inferior ones. Note for example, in _L'Etoile du Nord_, the passage, _Enfants de l'Ukraine fils du d\u00e9sert_. The opening passage is lofty, determined and picturesque, but it ends most disagreeably.", "He always lived alone with no fixed place of abode. He was at Spa in the summer and on the Mediterranean in the winter; in large cities only as business drew him. He had no financial worries and he lived only to continue his Penelope-like work, which showed a great love of perfection, although he did not find the best way of attaining it. They have tried to place this conscientious artist in the list of seekers of success, but such men are not ordinarily accustomed to work like this.", "Since I have used the word artist, it is proper to stop for a moment. Unlike Gluck and Berlioz, who were greater artists than musicians, Meyerbeer was more a musician than an artist. As a result, he often used the most refined and learned means to achieve a very ordinary artistic result. But there is no reason why he should be brought to task for results which they do not even remark in the works of so many others.", "Meyerbeer was the undisputed leader in the operatic world when Robert Schumann struck the first blow at his supremacy. Schumann was ignorant of the stage, although he had made one unfortunate venture there. He did not appreciate that there is more than one way to practise the art of music. But he attacked Meyerbeer, violently, for his bad taste and Italian tendencies, entirely forgetting that when Mozart, Beethoven, and Weber did work for the stage they were strongly drawn towards Italian art. Later, the Wagnerians wanted to oust Meyerbeer from the stage and make a place for themselves, and they got credit for some of Schumann's harsh criticisms,--this, too, despite the fact that at the beginning of the skirmish Schumann and the Wagnerians got along about as well as Ingres and Delacroix and their schools. But they united against the common enemy and the French critics followed. The critics entirely neglected Berlioz's opinion, for, after opposing Meyerbeer for a long time, he admitted him among the gods and in his _Trait\u00e9 d'Instrumentation_ awarded him the crown of immortality.", "Parenthetically, if there is a surprising page in the history of music it is the persistent affectation of classing Berlioz and Wagner together. They had nothing in common save their great love of art and their distrust of established forms. Berlioz abhorred enharmonic modulations, dissonances resolved indefinitely one after another, continuous melody and all current practices of futuristic music. He carried this so far that he claimed that he understood nothing in the prelude to _Tristan_, which was certainly a sincere claim since, almost simultaneously, he hailed the overture of _Lohengrin_, which is conceived in an entirely different manner, as a masterpiece. He did not admit that the voice should be sacrificed and relegated to the rank of a simple unit of the orchestra. Wagner, for his part, showed at his best an elegance and artistry of pen which may be searched for in vain in Berlioz's work. Berlioz opened to the orchestra the doors of a new world. Wagner hurled himself into this unknown country and found numerous lands to till there. But what dissimilarities there are in the styles of the two men! In their methods of treating the orchestra and the voices, in their musical architectonics, and in their conception of opera!", "In spite of the great worth of _Les Troyens_ and _Benvenuto Cellini_, Berlioz shone brightest in the concert hall; Wagner is primarily a man of the theater. Berlioz showed clearly in _Les Troyens_ his intention of approaching Gluck, while Wagner freely avowed his indebtedness to Weber, and particularly to the score of _Euryanthe_. He might have added that he owed something to Marschner, but he never spoke of that.", "The more we study the works of these two men of genius, the more we are impressed by the tremendous difference between them. Their resemblance is simply one of those imaginary things which the critics too often mistake for a reality. The critics once found local color in Rossini's _Semiramide_!", "If we fail to recognize Meyerbeer's genius, we are not only unjust but also ungrateful. In every sense, in his conception of opera, in his treatment of orchestration, in his handling of choruses, even in stage setting, he gave us new principles by which our modern works have profited to a large extent.", "\"In addition to eminent musical talents, Meyerbeer had a highly developed instinct for the stage. He goes to the heart of a situation, follows closely the meanings of the words, and observes both the historical and local color of his subject.... Few composers have understood opera so well.\"", "The success of the Italian school appeared to have utterly ruined this understanding and care for local and historical color. Rossini in the last act of _Otello_ and in _Guillaume Tell_ began its renaissance with a boldness for which he deserves credit, but it was left to Meyerbeer to restore it to its former glory.", "It is impossible to deny his individuality. The amalgamation of his Germanic tendencies with his Italian education and his French preferences formed an ore of new brilliancy and new depth of tone. His style resembled none other. F\u00e9tis, his great admirer and friend and the famous director of the Conservatoire at Brussels, insisted, and with reason, on this distinction. His style was characterized by the importance of the rhythmic element. His ballet music owes much of its excellence to the picturesque variety of the rhythms.", "Instead of the long involved overture he gave us the short distinctive prelude which has been so successful. The preludes of _Robert_ and _Les Huguenots_ were followed by the preludes of _Lohengrin_, _Faust_, _Tristan_, _Romeo_, _La Traviata_, _A\u00efda_, and many others which are less famous. Verdi in his last two works and Richard Strauss in _Salome_ went even farther and suppressed the prelude--a none too agreeable surprise. It is like a dinner without soup.", "Meyerbeer gave us a foretaste of the famous _leit-motif_. We find it in _Robert_ in the theme of the ballad, which the orchestra plays again while Bertram goes towards the back of the stage. This should indicate to the listener his satanic character. We find it in the Luther chant in _Les Huguenots_ and also in the dream of _Le Proph\u00e8te_ during Jean's recitative. Here the orchestra with its modulated tone predicts the future splendor of the cathedral scene, while a lute plays low notes, embellished by a delicate weaving in of the violins, and produces a remarkable and unprecedented effect. He introduced on the stage the ensembles of wind instruments (I do not mean the brass) which are so frequent in Mozart's great concertos. An illustration of this is the entrance of Alice in the second act of _Robert_. An echo of this is found in Elsa's entrance in the second act of _Lohengrin_. Another illustration is the entrance of Berthe and Fid\u00e8s in the beginning of the _Le Proph\u00e8te_. In this case the author indicated a pantomime. This is never played and so this pretty bit loses all its significance.", "Meyerbeer ventured to use combinations in harmony which were considered rash at that time. They pretend that the sensitiveness of the ear has been developed since then, but in reality it has been dulled by having to undergo the most violent discords.", "The beautiful \"progression\" of the exorcism in the fourth act of _Le Proph\u00e8te_ was not accepted without some difficulty. I can still see Gounod seated at a piano singing the debated passage and trying to convince a group of recalcitrant listeners of its beauty.", "Meyerbeer developed the r\u00f4le of the English horn, which up to that time had been used only rarely and timidly, and he also introduced the bass clarinet into the orchestra. But the two instruments, as he used them, still appeared somewhat unusual. They were objects of luxury, strangers of distinction which one saluted respectfully and which played no great part. Under Wagner's management they became a definite part of the household and, as we know, brought in a wealth of coloring.", "It is an open question whether it was Meyerbeer or Scribe who planned the amazing stage setting in the cathedral scene in _Le Proph\u00e8te_. It must have been Meyerbeer, for Scribe was not temperamentally a revolutionist, and this scene was really revolutionary. The brilliant procession with its crowd of performers which goes across the stage through the nave into the choir, constantly keeping its distance from the audience, is an impressive, realistic and beautiful scene. But directors who go to great expense for the costumes cannot understand why the procession should file anywhere except before the footlights as near the audience as possible, and it is extremely difficult to get any other method of procedure.", "Furthermore, the amusing idea of the skating ballet was due to Meyerbeer. At the time there was an amusing fellow in Paris who had invented roller skates and who used to practise his favorite sport on fine evenings on the large concrete surfaces of the Place de la Concorde. Meyerbeer saw him and got the idea of the famous ballet. In the early days of the opera it certainly was charming to see the skaters come on accompanied by a pretty chorus and a rhythm from the violins regulated by that of the dancers. But the performance began at seven and ended at midnight. Now they begin at eight and to gain the hour they had to accelerate the pace. So the chorus in question was sacrificed. That was bad for _Les Huguenots_. The author tried to make a good deal out of the last act with its beautiful choruses in the church--a development of the Luther chant--and the terror of the approaching massacre. But this act has been cut, mutilated and made generally unrecognizable. They even go so far in some of the foreign houses as to suppress it entirely.", "I once saw the last act in all its integrity and with six harps accompanying the famous trio. We shall never see the six harps again, for Garnier, instead of reproducing exactly the placing of the orchestra in the old Op\u00e9ra, managed so well in the new one that they are unable to put in the six harps of old or the four drums with which Meyerbeer got such surprising effects in _Robert_ and _Le Proph\u00e8te_. I believe, however, that recent improvements have averted this disaster in a certain measure, and that there is now a place for the drums. But we shall never hear the six harps again.", "We must say something of the genesis of Meyerbeer's works, for in many instances this was curious and few people know about it.", "We might like to see works spring from the author's brain as complete as Minerva was when she sprang from Jove's, but that is infrequently the case. When we study the long series of operas which Gluck wrote, we are surprised to meet some things which we recognize as having seen before in the masterpieces which immortalize his name. And often the music is adapted to entirely different situations in the changed form. The words of a follower become the awesome prophecy of a high priest. The trio in _Orph\u00e9e_ with its tender love and expressions of perfect happiness fairly trembles with accents of sorrow. The music had been written for an entirely different situation which justified them. Massenet has told us that he borrowed right and left from his unpublished score, _La Coupe du Roi de Thul\u00e9_. That is what Gluck did with his _Elena e Paride_ which had little success. I may as well confess that one of the ballets in _Henry VIII_ came from the finale of an op\u00e9ra-comique in one act. This work was finished and ready to go to rehearsal when the whole thing was stopped because I had the audacity to assert to Nestor Roqueplan, the director of Favart Hall, that Mozart's _Le Nozze di Figaro_ was a masterpiece.", "Meyerbeer, even more than anyone, tried not to lose his ideas and the study of their transformation is extremely interesting. One day Nuitter, the archivist at the Op\u00e9ra, learned of an important sale of manuscripts in Berlin. He attended the sale and brought back a lot of Meyerbeer's rough drafts which included studies for a _Faust_ that the author never finished. These fragments give no idea what the piece would have been. We see Faust and Mephistopheles walking in Hell. They come to the Tree of Human Knowledge on the banks of the Styx and Faust picks the fruit. From this detail it is easy to imagine that the libretto is bizarre. The authorship of this amazing libretto is unknown, but it is not strange that Meyerbeer soon abandoned it. From this still-born _Faust_, Scribe, at the request of the author, constructed _Robert le Diable_. An aria sung by Faust on the banks of the Styx becomes the _Valse Infernale_.", "The necessity of utilizing pre-existing fragments explains some of the incoherence of this incomprehensible piece. It also explains the creation of Bertram, half man, half devil, who was invented as a substitute for Mephistopheles. The fruit of the Tree of Human Knowledge became the _Rameau V\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9e_ in the third act, and the beautiful religious scene in the fifth act, which has no relation to the action, is a transposition of the Easter scene.", "So Scribe should not be blamed for making a poor piece when he had so many difficulties to contend with. He must have lost his head a little for Robert's mother was called Berthe in the first act and Rosalie in the third. However, the answer might be that she changed her name when she became religious.", "Later, Scribe was put to another no less difficult test with _L'Etoile du Nord_. When Meyerbeer was the conductor at the Berlin Op\u00e9ra, he wrote on command _Le Camp de Sil\u00e9sie_ with Frederick the Great as the hero and Jenny Lind as the musical star. As we know, Frederick was a musician, for he both composed music and played the flute, while Jenny Lind, the Swedish nightingale, was a great singer. A contest between the nightingale and the flute was sure to follow or theatrical instinct is a vain phrase. But in the piece Scribe created, Peter the Great took Frederick the Great's place and to give a motive for the grace notes in the last act it was necessary for the terrible Tsar, a half savage barbarian, to learn to play the flute.", "It is not worth while telling how the Tsar took lessons on the flute from a young pastry cook who came on the stage with a basket of cakes on his head; how the cook later became a lord, and many other details of this absurd play. It is permitted to be absurd on the stage, if it is done so that the absurdity is forgotten. But in this instance it was impossible to forget the absurdities. The extravagance of the libretto led the musician into many unfortunate things. This extremely interesting score is very uneven, but there are a thousand details worth the attention of the professional musician. Beauty even appears in the score at moments, and there are charming and picturesque bits, as well as puerilities and shocking vulgarities.", "Public curiosity was aroused for a long time by clever advance notices and had reached a high pitch when _L'Etoile du Nord_ appeared. The work was carried by the exceptional talents of Bataille and Caroline Duprez and was enormously successful at the start, but this success has grown steadily less. Faure and Madame Patti gave some fine performances in London. We shall probably never see their equal again, and it is not desirable that we should either from the standpoint of art or of the author.", "_Les Huguenots_ was not an opera pieced together out of others, but it did not reach the public as the author wrote it. At the beginning of the first act there was a game of cup and ball on which the author had set his heart. But the balls had to strike at the exact moment indicated in the score and the players never succeeded in accomplishing that. The passage had to be suppressed but it is preserved in the library at the Op\u00e9ra. They also had to suppress the part of Catherine de Medici who should preside at the conference where the massacre of St. Bartholomew was planned. Her part was merged with that of St. Pris. They also suppressed the first scene in the last act, where Raoul, disheveled and covered with blood, interrupted the ball and upset the merriment by announcing the massacre to the astonished dancers.", "But it is a question whether we should believe the legend that the great duet, the climax of the whole work, was improvised during the rehearsals at the request of Norritt and Madame Falcon. It is hard to believe that. The work, as is well known, was taken from Merimee's _Chronique du r\u00e8gne de Charles IX_. This scene is in the romance and it is almost impossible that Meyerbeer had no idea of putting it into his opera. More probably the people at the theatre wanted the act to end with the blessing of the daggers, and the author with his duet in his portfolio only had to take it out to satisfy his interpreters. A beautiful scene like this with its sweep and pleasing innovation is not written hastily. This duet should be heard when the author's intentions and the nuances which make a part of the idea are respected and not replaced by inventions in bad taste which they dare to call traditions. The real traditions have been lost and this admirable scene has lost its beauty.", "The manner in which the duet ends has not been noted sufficiently. Raoul's phrase, _God guard our days. God of our refuge!_ remains in suspense and the orchestra brings it to an end, the first example of a practice used frequently in modern works.", "We do not know how Meyerbeer got his idea of putting the schismatic John Huss on the stage under the name of John of Leyden. Whether this idea was original with him or was suggested by Scribe, who made a fantastic person out of John, we do not know. We only know that the r\u00f4le of the prophet's mother was originally intended for Madame Stoltz, but she had left the Op\u00e9ra. Meyerbeer heard Madame Pauline Viardot at Vienna and found in her his ideal, so he created the redoubtable r\u00f4le of Fid\u00e8s for her. The part of Jean was given to the tenor Roger, the star of the Op\u00e9ra-Comique, and he played and sang it well. Levasseur, the Marcel of _Les Huguenots_ and the Bertram of _Robert_, played the part of Zacharie.", "_Le Proph\u00e8te_ was enormously successful in spite of the then powerful censer-bearers of the Italian school. We now see its defects rather than its merits. Meyerbeer is criticised for not putting into practice theories he did not know and no account is taken of his fearlessness, which was great for that period. No one else could have drawn the cathedral scene with such breadth of stroke and extraordinary brilliancy. The paraphrase of _Domine salvum fac regem_ reveals great ingenuity. His method of treating the organ is wonderful, and his idea of the ritournello _Sur le Jeu de hautbois_ is charming. This precedes and introduces the children's chorus, and is constructed on a novel theme which is developed brilliantly by the choruses, the orchestra and the organ combined. The repetition of the _Domine Salvum_ at the end of the scene, which bursts forth abruptly in a different key, is full of color and character.", "The story of _Le Pardon de Plo\u00ebrmel_ is interesting. It was first called _Dinorah_, a name which Meyerbeer picked up abroad. But Meyerbeer liked to change the titles of his operas several times in the course of the rehearsals in order to keep public curiosity at fever heat. He had the notion of writing an op\u00e9ra-comique in one act, and he asked his favorite collaborators, Jules Barbier and Michael Carr\u00e9, for a libretto. They produced _Dinorah_ in three scenes and with but three characters. The music was written promptly and was given to Perrin, the famous director, whose unfortunate influence soon made itself felt. A director's first idea at that time was to demand changes in the piece given him. \"A single act by you, Master? Is that permissible? What can we put on after that? A new work by Meyerbeer should take up the entire evening.\" That was the way the insidious director talked, and there was all the more chance of his being listened to as the author was possessed by a mania for retouching and making changes. So Meyerbeer took the score to the Mediterranean where he spent the winter. The next spring he brought back the work developed into three acts with choruses and minor characters. Besides these additions he had written the words which Barbier and Carr\u00e9 should have done.", "The rehearsals were tedious. Meyerbeer wanted Faure and Madame Carvalho in the leading r\u00f4les but one was at the Op\u00e9ra-Comique and the other at her own house, the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Lyrique. The work went back and forth from the Place Favart to the Place du Ch\u00e2telet. But the author's hesitancy was at bottom only a pretext. What he wanted was to secure a postponement of Limnander's opera _Les Blancs et les Bleus_. The action of this work and of _Dinorah_, as well, took place in Brittany. In the hope of being Meyerbeer's choice, both theatres turned poor Limnander away. Finally, _Dinorah_ fell to the Op\u00e9ra-Comique. After long hard work, which the author demanded, Madame Cabel and MM. Faure and Sainte-Foix gave a perfect performance.", "There was a good deal of criticism of having the hunter, the reaper, and the shepherd sing a prayer together at the beginning of the third act. This was not considered theatrical; to-day that is a virtue.", "There was a good deal of talk about _L'Africanne_, which had been looked for for a long time and which seemed to be almost legendary and mysterious; it still is for that matter. The subject of the opera was unknown. All that was known was that the author was trying to find an interpreter and could get none to his liking.", "Then Marie Cruvelli, a German singer with an Italian training, appeared. With her beauty and prodigious voice she shone like a meteor in the theatrical firmament. Meyerbeer found his Africanne realized in her and at his request she was engaged at the Op\u00e9ra. Her engagement was made the occasion for a brilliant revival of _Les Huguenots_ and Meyerbeer wrote new ballet music for it. To-day we have no idea of what _Les Huguenots_ was then. Then the author went back to his Africanne and went to work again. He used to go to see the brilliant singer about it nearly every day, when she suddenly announced that she was going to leave the stage to become the Comtesse Vigier! Meyerbeer was discouraged and he threw his unfinished manuscript into a drawer where it stayed until Marie Sass had so developed her voice and talent that he made up his mind to entrust the r\u00f4le of S\u00e9lika to her. He wanted Faure for the r\u00f4le of Nelusko and he was already at the Op\u00e9ra, so he had the management engage Naudin, the Italian tenor, as well.", "But Scribe had died during the long period which had elapsed since the marriage of the Comtesse Vigier. Meyerbeer was now left to himself, and too much inclined to revisions of every kind as he was, re-made the piece to his fancy. When it was completed--it didn't resemble anything and the author planned to finish it at the rehearsals.", "As we know, Meyerbeer died suddenly. He realized that he was dying and as he knew how necessary his presence was for a performance of _L'Africanne_ he forbade its appearance. But his prohibition was only verbal as he could no longer write. The public was impatiently awaiting _L'Africanne_, so they went ahead with it.", "When Perrin and his nephew du Locle opened the package of manuscripts Meyerbeer had left, they were stupefied at finding no _L'Africanne_.", "He summoned F\u00e9tis, Meyerbeer's enthusiastic admirer, and the three, F\u00e9tis, Perrin and du Locle, managed to evolve the opera we know from the scraps the author had left in disorder. They did not accomplish this, however, without considerable difficulty, without some incoherences, numerous suppressions and even additions. Perrin was the inventor of the wonderful map on which S\u00e9lika recognized Madagascar. They took the characters there in order to justify the term Africanne applied to the heroine. They also introduced the Brahmin religion to Madagascar in order to avoid moving the characters to India where the fourth act should take place. The first performance was imminent when they found that the work was too long. So they cut out an original ballet where a savage beat a tom-tom, and they cut and fitted together mercilessly. In the last act S\u00e9lika, alone and dying, should see the paradise of the Brahmins appear as in a vision. But Faure wanted to appear again at the finale, so they had to adapt a bit taken from the third act and suppress the vision. This is the reason why Nelusko succumbs so quickly to the deadly perfume of the poisonous flowers, while S\u00e9lika resists so long. The riturnello of S\u00e9lika's aria, which should be performed with lowered curtain as the queen gazes over the sea and at the departing vessel far away on the horizon, became a vehicle for encores--the last thing that was ever in Meyerbeer's mind. But the worst was the liberty F\u00e9tis took in retouching the orchestration. As a compliment to Adolph Sax he substituted a saxaphone for the bass clarinet which the author indicated. This resulted in the suppression of that part of the aria beginning _O Paradis sorti de l'onde_ as the saxophone did not produce a good effect. F\u00e9tis also allowed Perrin to make over a bass solo into a chorus, the Bishop's Chorus. The great vocal range in this is poorly adapted for a chorus. Some barbarous modulations are certainly apocryphal....", "We are unable to imagine what _L'Africanne_ would have been if Scribe had lived and the authors had put it into shape. The work we have is illogical and incomplete. The words are simply monstrous and Scribe certainly would not have kept them. This is the case in the passage in the great duet:", "The music stitched to this impossible piece, however, had its admirers--even fanatical admirers--so great was the prestige of the author's name at the time of its appearance. We must not forget that there are, indeed, some beautiful pages in this chaos. The religious ceremony in the fourth act and the Brahmin recitative accompanied by the _pizzicati_ of the bass may be mentioned as an indication of this. The latter passage is not in favor, however; they play it down without conviction and so deprive it of all its strength and majesty.", "I said, at the beginning of this study, that we were ungrateful to Meyerbeer, and this ingratitude is double on the part of France, for he loved her. He only had to say the word to have any theatre in Europe opened to him, yet he preferred to them all the Op\u00e9ra at Paris and even the Op\u00e9ra-Comique where the choruses and orchestra left much to be desired. When he did work for Paris after he had given _Margherita d'Anjou_ and _Le Crociato_ in Italy, he was forced to accommodate himself to French taste just as Rossini and Donizetti were. The latter wrote for the Op\u00e9ra-Comique _La Fille du R\u00e9giment_, a military and patriotic work, and its dashing and glorious _Salut \u00e0 la France_ has resounded through the whole world. Foreigners do not take so much pains in our day, and France applauds _Die Meistersinger_ which ends with a hymn to German art. Such is progress!", "Something must be said of a little known score, _Struens\u00e9e_, which was written for a drama which was so weak that it prevented the music gaining the success it deserved. The composer showed himself in this more artistic than in anything else he did. It should have been heard at the Od\u00e9on with another piece written by Jules Barbier on the same subject. The overture used to appear in the concerts as did the polonnaise, but like the overture to _Guillaume Tell_, they have disappeared. These overtures are not negligible. The overture to _Guillaume Tell_ is notable for the unusual invention of the five violoncellos and its storm with its original beginning, to say nothing of its pretty pastoral. The fine depth of tone in the exordium of _Struens\u00e9e_ and the fugue development in the main theme are also not to be despised. But all that, we are told, is lacking in elevation and depth. Possibly; but it is not always necessary to descend to Hell and go up to Heaven. There is certainly more music in these overtures than in Grieg's _Peer Gynt_ which has been dinned into our ears so much.", "But enough of this. I must stop with the operas, for to consider the rest of his music would necessitate a study of its own and that would take us too far afield. My hope is that these lines may repair an unnecessary injustice and redirect the fastidious who may read them to a great musician whom the general public has never ceased to listen to and applaud.", "It is dangerous to prophesy. Not long ago I was speaking of Offenbach, trying to do justice to his marvellous natural gifts and deploring his squandering them. And I was imprudent enough to say that posterity would never know him. Now posterity is proving that I was wrong, for Offenbach is coming back into fashion. Our contemporaneous composers forget that Mozart, Beethoven and Sebastian Bach knew how to laugh at times. They distrust all gaiety and declare it unesthetic. As the good public cannot resign itself to getting along without gaiety, it goes to operetta and turns naturally to Offenbach who created it and furnished an inexhaustible supply. My phrase is not exaggerated, for Offenbach hardly dreamed of creating an art. He was endowed with a genius for the comic and an abundance of melody, but he had no thought of doing anything beyond providing material for the theatre he managed at the time. As a matter of fact he was almost its only author.", "He was unable to rid himself of his Germanic influences and so corrupted the taste of an entire generation by his false prosody, which has been incorrectly considered originality. In addition he was lacking in taste. At the time they affected a dreadful mannerism of always stopping on the next to the last note of a passage, whether or not it was associated with a mute syllable. This mannerism had no purpose beyond indicating to the audience the end of a passage and giving the claque the signal to applaud. Offenbach did not belong to that heroic strain to which success is the least of its cares. So he adopted this mannerism, and often his ingeniously turned and charming couplets are ruined by this silly absurdity now gone out of fashion.", "Furthermore, he wrote badly, for his early education was neglected. If the _Tales of Hoffman_ shows traces of a practised pen, it is because Guiraud finished the score and went out of his way to remedy some of the author's mistakes. Leaving aside the bad prosody and the minor defects in taste, we have left a work which shows a wealth of invention, melody, and sparkling fancy comparable to Gr\u00e9try's.", "Gr\u00e9try was no more a great musician than Offenbach, for he also wrote badly. The essential difference between the two was the care, not only in his prosody but also in his declamation, which Gr\u00e9try tried to reproduce musically with all possible exactness. He overshot the mark in this for he did not see that in singing the expression of a note is modified by the harmonic scheme which accompanies it. It must be recognized, in addition, that many times Gr\u00e9try was carried away by his melodic inventiveness and forgot his own principles so that he relegated his care for declamation to second place.", "What hurt Gr\u00e9try was his unbounded conceit, with which Offenbach, to his credit, was never afflicted. As an indication of this, he dared to write in his advice to young musicians:", "\"Those who have genius will make op\u00e9ra-comique like mine; those who have talent will write opera like Gluck's; while those who have neither genius nor talent, will write symphonies like Haydn's.\"", "However, he tried to make an opera like Gluck's and in spite of his great efforts and his interesting inventions, he could not equal the work of his formidable rival.", "Although he was not a great musician, Offenbach had a surprising natural instinct and made here and there curious discoveries in harmony. In speaking of these discoveries I must go slightly into the theory of harmony and resign myself to being understood only by those of my readers who are more or less musicians. In a slight work, _Daphnis et Chlo\u00e9_, Offenbach risked a dominant eleventh without either introduction or conclusion--an extraordinary audacity at the time. A short course in harmony is necessary for the understanding of this. We must start with the fact that, theoretically, all dissonances must be introduced and concluded, which we cannot explain here, but this leading up to and away from have for their purpose softening the harshness of the dissonance which was greatly feared in bygone times. Take if you please, the simple key of C natural. _Do_ is the keynote, _sol_ is the dominant. Place on this dominant two-thirds--_si-re_--and you have the perfect dominant chord. Add a third _fa_ and you have the famous dominant seventh, a dissonance which to-day seems actually agreeable. Not so long ago they thought that they ought to prepare for the dissonance. In the Sixteenth Century it was not regarded as admissible at all, for one hears the two notes _si_ and _fa_ simultaneously and this seems intolerable to the ear. They used to call it the _Diabolus in musica_.", "Palestrina was the first to employ it in an anthem. Opinions differ on this, and certain students of harmony pretend that the chord which Palestrina used only has the appearance of the dominant seventh. I do not concur in this view. But however the case may be, the glory of unchaining the devil in music belongs to Montreverde. That was the beginning of modern music.", "Later, a new third was superimposed and they dared the chord _sol-si-re-fa-la_. The inventor is unknown, but Beethoven seems to have been the first to make any considerable use of it. He used the chord in such a way that, in spite of its current use to-day, in his works it appears like something new and strange. This chord imposes its characteristics on the second _motif_ of the first part of the _Symphony in C minor_. This is what gives such amazing charm to the long colloquy between the flute, the oboe and the clarinets, which always surprises and arouses the listener, in the _andante_ of the same symphony. F\u00e9tis in his _Trait\u00e9 d'Harmonie_ inveighed against this delightful passage. He admits that people like it, but, according to him, the author had no right to write it and the listener has no right to admire it. Scholars often have strange ideas.", "Then Richard Wagner came along and the reign of the ninth dominant took the place of the seventh. That is what gives _Tannhauser_, and _Lohengrin_ their exciting character, which is dear to those who demand in music above everything else the pleasure due to shocks to the nervous system. Imitators have fallen foul of this easy procedure, and with a laughable na\u00efvet\u00e9 imagine that in this way they can easily equal Wagner. And they have succeeded in making this valuable chord absolutely banal.", "By adding still another third we have the dominant eleventh. Offenbach used this, but it has played but a small part since then. Beyond that we cannot go, for a third more and we are back to the basic note, two octaves away.", "But innovations in harmony are rare in Offenbach's work. What makes him interesting is his fertility in invention of melodies and few have equaled him in this. He improvised constantly and with incredible rapidity. His manuscripts give the impression of having been done with the point of a needle. There is nothing useless anywhere in them. He used abbreviations as much as he could and the simplicity of his harmony helped him here. As a result he was able to produce his light works in an exceedingly short time.", "He had the luck to attach Madame Ugalde to his company. Her powers had already begun to decline but she was still brilliant. While she was giving a spectacular revival of _Orph\u00e9e aux Enfers_, he wrote _Les Bavards_ for her. He was inspired by the hope of an unusual interpretation and he so surpassed himself that he produced a small masterpiece. A revival of this work would certainly be successful if that were possible, but the peculiar merits of the creatrix of the r\u00f4le would be necessary and I do not see her like anywhere.", "It is strange but true that Offenbach lost all his good qualities as soon as he took himself seriously. But he was not the only case of this in the history of music. Cramer and Clementi wrote studies and exercises which are marvels of style, but their sonatas and concertos are tiresome in their mediocrity. Offenbach's works which were given at the Op\u00e9ra-Comique--_Robinson Cruso\u00e9_, _Vert-Vert_, and _Fantasio_ are much inferior to _La Chanson de Fortunio_, _La Belle H\u00e9l\u00e8ne_ and many other justly famous operettas. There have been several unprofitable revivals of _La Belle H\u00e9l\u00e8ne_. This is due to the fact that the r\u00f4le of H\u00e9l\u00e8ne was designed for Mlle. Schneider. She was beautiful and talented and had an admirable mezzo-soprano voice. The slight voice of the ordinary singer of operetta is insufficient for the part. Furthermore, traditions have sprung up. The comic element has been suppressed and the piece has been denatured by this change. In Germany they conceived the idea of playing this farce seriously with an archaic stage setting!", "Queen Victoria did me the honor to receive me twice at Windsor Castle, and Queen Alexandra paid me the same honor at Buckingham Palace in London. The first time I saw Queen Victoria I was presented to her by the Baroness de Caters. She was the daughter of Lablache and had one of the most beautiful voices and the greatest talent that I have ever known. This charming woman had been left a widow and so she became an artist, appearing in concerts and giving singing lessons. At the time of which I speak she was teaching Princess Beatrice, now the mother-in-law of the King of Spain. In all the glory of the freshness of youth, the Princess was endowed with a charming voice which the Baroness guided perfectly. The Princess received Madame de Caters and myself with a gracefulness which was increased by her unusual bashfulness. Her Majesty, in the meantime, was finishing her luncheon. I was somewhat apprehensive through having heard of the coldness which the Queen affected at this sort of audience, so I was more than surprised when she came in with both hands extended to take mine and when she addressed me with real cordiality. She was very fond of Baroness de Caters and that was the secret of the reception which put me at my ease at once.", "Her Majesty wanted to hear me play the organ (there is an excellent one in the chapel at Windsor), and then the piano. Finally, I had the honor of accompanying the Princess as she sang the aria from _Etienne Marcel_. Her Royal Highness sang with great clearness and distinctness, but it was the first time she had sung before her august mother and she was frightened almost to death. The Queen was so delighted that some days later, without my being told of it, she summoned to Windsor, Madame Gye, wife of the manager of Covent Garden,--the famous singer Albani--to ask to have _Etienne Marcel_ staged at her own theatre. The Queen's wish was not granted.", "I returned to Windsor seventeen years later, in company with Johann Wolf, who was for many years Queen Victoria's chosen violinist. We dined at the palace, and, if we did not enjoy the distinction of sitting at the royal table, we were nevertheless in good company with the young princesses, daughters of the Duke of Connaught. We were lodged at a hotel for the honor of sleeping at the Castle was reserved for very important personages--an honor which need not be envied, for the sleeping apartments are really servants' rooms. But etiquette decrees it.", "Dinner was over, and princes in full uniform and princesses in elaborate evening dress stood about, waiting for her Majesty's appearance. I was heartbroken when I saw her enter, for she was almost carried by her Indian servant and obviously could not walk alone. But once seated at a small table, she was just as she had been before, with her wonderful charm, her simple manner and her musical voice. Only her white hair bore witness to the years that had passed. She asked me about _Henri VIII_, which was being given for the second time at Covent Garden, and I explained to her that in my desire to give the piece the local color of its times I had been ferreting about in the royal library at Buckingham Palace, to which my friend, the librarian, had given me access. And I also told how I had found in a great collection of manuscripts of the Sixteenth Century an exquisitely fine theme arranged for the harpsichord, which served as the framework for the opera--I used it later for the march I wrote for the coronation of King Edward. The Queen was much interested in music in general and she appeared to be especially pleased in this discussion. His Highness the Duke of Connaught wrote me that she had spoken of it several times.", "The musical library at Buckingham Palace is most remarkable and it is a pity that access to it is not easier. Among other things, there are the manuscripts of Handel's oratorios, written for the most part with disconcerting rapidity. His _Messiah_ was composed in fifteen days! The rudimentary instrumentation of the time made such speed possible, yet who is there to-day who could write all those fugue choruses with such speed? The fugue manner, which seems laborious to us, was current at the time and they were practised in it. The library also contains works of Handel's contemporaries, which are executed with the same mastery. We cannot say whether they were written with the same rapidity as Handel's, but it is easy to see that there was a general ability to do so, just as now it is a matter of common attainment to produce complicated orchestral effects, the possibility of which the old masters had no conception. What made Handel superior to his rivals was the romantic and picturesque side of his works; probably also, his prodigious and unvarying fertility.", "The last word has been said about Queen Victoria, yet the peculiar charm which radiated from her personality cannot be too highly praised. She seemed the personification of England. When she passed on, it seemed as though a great void were left. All King Edward's splendid qualities were necessary to take her place, combined with the effect of the world's surprise at discovering a great king where they had expected to see only a brilliant prince who had been a constant lover of pomp and pleasure.", "I was later admitted to Buckingham Palace to play with Josef Hollman, the violinist, before Queen Alexandra. We both were eager for this opportunity which we were told was impossible. The Queen was very busy, and, in addition, she was in mourning for the successive deaths of her father and mother, the King and Queen of Denmark. Suddenly, however, we learned that she would receive us. She was pale and appeared to be feeble, but she received us with the utmost cordiality. She spoke to me about her mother, whom I had seen at Copenhagen with her sisters the Empress Dowager of Russia, and the Princess of Hanover whom politics deprived of a crown which was hers by right. I have a very pleasant recollection of this visit. I do not know how it happened but I remained speechless at this lead from the Queen. She brought the subject up a second time and my timidity still prevented my responding. I ought to have had many things to say to one so obviously eager to listen. This Queen of Denmark, with her eighty years, was the most delightful old lady imaginable. Erect, slight, alert of mind and unfaltering of speech, she reminded me vividly of my maternal great-aunt, that extraordinary woman, who gave me my first notions of things and directed my hand on the keys so well.", "A singer whom I had never seen or heard of, but of whom I had heard poor reports, had written Queen Louise that I wanted to accompany her to court. The Queen asked me if I knew her and if what she had written was true. My surprise was so great that I could not repress a start, which I followed by an exclamation of denial, which appeared to amuse her greatly. \"I did not doubt it,\" she said, \"but I'm not sorry to be sure.\"", "Queen Alexandra was accompanied by Lady Gray, her great friend, and the hereditary princess of Greece. After M. Hollman and I had played a duet, she expressed a desire to hear me play alone. As I attempted to lift the lid of the piano, she stepped forward to help me raise it before the maids of honor could intervene. After this slight concert she delivered to each of us, in her own name and in that of the absent king, a gold medal commemorative of artistic merit, and she offered us a cup of tea which she poured with her royal and imperial hands.", "Other queens have also received me--Queen Christine of Spain and Queen Amelie of Portugal. After Queen Christine had heard me play on the piano, she expressed a desire to hear me play the organ, and they chose for this an excellent instrument made by Cavaill\u00e9-Coll in a church whose name I have forgotten. The day was fixed for this ceremony, which would naturally have been of a private character, when some great ladies lectured the indiscreet queen for daring to resort to a sacred place for any purpose besides taking part in divine services. The queen was displeased by this remonstrance and she responded by coming to the church not only not incognito, but in great state, with the king (he was very young), the ministers and the court, while horsemen stationed at intervals blew their trumpets. I had written a religious march especially for this event, and the Queen kindly accepted its dedication to her. I was a little flustered when she asked me to play the too familiar melody from _Samson et Dalila_ which begins _Mon coeur s'ouvre \u00e0 ta voix_. I had to improvise a transposition suited for the organ, something I had never dreamt of doing. During the performance the Queen leaned her elbow on the keyboard of the organ, her chin resting on one hand and her eyes upturned. She seemed rapt in exstasy which, as may be imagined, was not precisely displeasing to the author.", "The press of the day printed delightful articles about the scene, but with no pretense to accuracy. I had nothing to do with that in any way.", "Her Majesty Queen Amelie of Portugal once honored me in a distinctive manner. She received me alone without any of her ladies of honor, which allowed her to dispense with all etiquette and to have me sit in a chair near her. In this intimate way she entertained me for three-quarters of an hour asking questions on all sorts of subjects. I had the chance to tell her how the oriental theme of the ballet in _Samson_ had been given to me years before by General Yusuf, and to give her many details of that interesting personage of whom she had heard her uncles speak.", "\"I am going to leave you,\" she said at last, \"but not because I want to. If one conscientiously practices the _metier_ of being a queen, one doesn't always find it amusing.\"", "In Rome I had the honor to be invited to a musicale at Queen Margharita's. The great drawing-rooms were filled with great ladies laden down with family jewels of fabulous value. All the music was terribly serious. Now this kind of music does not make for personal acquaintance, especially as all these great people were victims of a boredom they did their best to conceal. Afterwards the two queens wanted to talk to me. Queen H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, who is a violinist, told me that her children were learning the violin and the cello, an arrangement I praised highly, for the exclusive devotion to the piano in these later days has been the death of chamber music and almost of music itself.", "In my gallery of sovereigns I cannot forget the gracious Queen of Belgium. I have always seen her, however, in company with her august husband, and this story would become interminable if I were to include \"Their Majesties\" of the sterner sex--the Emperor of Germany, the Kings of Sweden, Denmark, Spain, Portugal....", "As I have had more to do with princes than with sovereigns, my tongue sometimes slips in talking to the latter. As I excused myself one day for addressing the Queen of Belgium as \"Highness,\" she replied, with a smile, \"Don't apologize; that recalls good times.\"", "She told me of the time when she and the king, then only heirs apparent, used to go up and down the Mediterranean coast in a little two-seated car. It was during this period that I had the honor of meeting them at the palace of his Serene Highness the Prince of Monaco, and of having charming and interesting personal conversation with them, for the king is a savant and the queen an artist.", "Ingres was famous for his violin. A single wall separated the apartment where I lived during my childhood and youth from the one where the painter Granger, one of Ingres's pupils, with his wife and daughter, lived. Granger painted the _Adoration of the Wise Men_ in the church of Notre Dame de Lorette. I have played with the gilt paper crown which his model wore when posing as one of the three kings. My mother and Mlle. Granger (who later became Madame Paul Meurice) both loved painting and became great friends. They copied together Paul Delaroche's _Enfants d'Edouard_ at the Louvre, a picture which was the rage at that time. My mother's paintings, in an admirable state of preservation, may be seen at the museum at Dieppe.", "I was introduced to Ingres when I was five years old through the Granger family. The distance from the Rue du Jardinet, where we lived, to the Quai Voltaire was not far, and we often went like a procession--the Grangers, my great-aunt Masson, my mother and I--to call upon Ingres and his wife, a delightfully simple woman whom everyone loved.", "Ingres often talked to me about Mozart, Gluck, and all the other great masters of music. When I was six years old, I composed an Adagio which I dedicated to him in all seriousness. Fortunately this masterpiece has been lost. As I already played, and rather nicely for my years, some of Mozart's sonatas, Ingres, in return for my dedication, presented me with a small medallion with the portrait of the author of Don Juan on one side, and this inscription on the other: \"To M. Saint-Sa\u00ebns, the charming interpreter of the divine artist.\"", "He carelessly omitted to add the date of this dedication, which would have increased its interest, for the idea of calling a knee-high youngster of six \"M. Saint-Sa\u00ebns\" was certainly unusual.", "In addition to the calls I paid him, when I was older I often met the great painter at the house of Frederic Reiset, one of his most ardent admirers. They made much of music in that household and we often heard there Delsarte, the singer without a voice, whom Ingres admired very much. Delsarte and Henri Reber were, in fact, his musical mentors, and, in spite of his pretence of being a great connoisseur, he was in reality their echo. He affected, for example, the most profound contempt for all modern music, and would not even listen to it. In this respect he reflected Reber. Reber used to say quietly in his far-away nasal voice, \"You've got to imitate somebody, so the best thing to do is to imitate the ancients, for they are the best.\" However, he undertook to prove the contrary by writing some particularly individual music, when he thought he was imitating Haydn and Mozart. Some of his works, in their perfection of line, their regard for details, their purity and their moderation remind one of Ingres's drawings which express so much in such a simple way. And Ingres, as well, although he tried to imitate Raphael, could only be himself. Reber would have been worthy of comparison with the painter, if he had had the power and productiveness which distinguish genius.", "What about Ingres's violin? Well, I saw this famous violin for the first time in the Montaubon Museum. Ingres never even spoke to me about it. He is said to have played it in his youth, but I could never persuade him to play even the slightest sonata with me. \"I used to play,\" he replied to my entreaties, \"the second violin in a quartet, but that is all.\"", "So I think I must be dreaming when I read, from time to time, that Ingres was more appreciative of compliments about his violin-playing than those about his painting. That is merely a legend, but it is impossible to destroy a legend. As the good La Fontaine said:", "I do not know whether Ingres showed talent for the violin in his youth or not. But I can state positively that in his maturity he showed none.", "Gustave Dor\u00e9 was also said to be famous on the violin, and his claims to consideration were far from inconsiderable. He had acquired a valuable instrument, on which he used to play Berlioz's _Concertos_ with a really extraordinary facility and spirit. These superficial works were enough for his musical powers. The surprising things about his execution was that he never worked at it. If he could not get a thing at once, he gave it up for good and all.", "He was a frequent attendant at Rossini's salon, and he belonged to the faction which supported melody and opposed \"learned scientific music.\" His temperament and mine hardly seem compatible, but friendship, like love, has its inexplicable mysteries, and gradually we became the best of friends. We lived in the same quarter and we visited each other frequently. As we almost never were of the same opinion about anything, we had interminable arguments, entirely free from rancor, which we thoroughly enjoyed.", "I finally became the confidant of his secret sorrows, and his innermost griefs. He was endowed with a wonderful visual memory, but he made the mistake of never using models, for in his opinion they were useless for an artist who knew his _metier_. So he condemned himself to a perpetual approximation, which was enough for illustrations demanding only life and character, but fatal for large canvasses, with half or full sized figures. This was the cause of his disappointments and failures which he attributed to malevolence and a hostility, which really did exist, but which took advantage of this opportunity to make the painter pay for the exaggerated success of the designer that had been extravagantly praised by the press from the beginning. He laid himself open to criticism through his abuse of his own facility. I have seen him painting away on thirty canvasses at the same time in his immense studio. Three seriously studied pictures would have been worth more.", "At heart this great overgrown jovial boy was melancholy and sensitive. He died young from heart disease, which was aggravated by grief over the death of his mother from whom he had never been separated.", "I dedicated a slight piece written for the violin to Dor\u00e9. This was not lost as the one to Ingres was, but it would be entirely unknown had not Johannes Wolf, the violinist of queens and empresses, done me the favor of placing it in his repertoire and bringing his fine talent to its aid.", "H\u00e9bert was the most serious of the painter-violinists. Down to the end of his life he delighted in playing the sonatas of Mozart and Beethoven, and, from all accounts, he played them remarkably. I can say this only from hearsay, for I never heard him. The few times that I ever saw him at home in my youth, I found him with his brush in hand. I saw him after that only at the Acad\u00e9mie, where we sat near each other, and he always greeted me cordially. We talked music from time to time, and he conversed like a connoisseur.", "Henri Regnault was the most musical of all the painters whom I have known. He did not need a violin--he was his own. Nature had endowed him with an exquisite tenor voice. It was alluring in its timbre and irresistible in its attractiveness, just as he was himself. He was no \"near musician.\" He loved music passionately, and he was unwilling to sing as an amateur. He took lessons from Romain Bussine at the Conservatoire. He sang to perfection the difficult arias of Mozart's _Don Juan_. He also liked to declaim the magnificent recitative of Pilgrimage in the third act of _Tannhauser_.", "As we were friendly and liked the same things, the sympathy which brought us together was quite natural. At the beginning of the war in 1870 I wrote _Les Melodies Persanes_ and Regnault was their first interpreter. _Sabre en main_ is dedicated to him. But his great success was _Le Cimiti\u00e8re_. Who would have thought as he sang:", "Some imbeciles have written that the loss of Regnault was not to be regretted; that he had said all he had to say. In reality he had given only the prologue of the great poem which he was working out in his brain. He had already ordered canvasses for great compositions which, without a doubt, would have been among the glories of French art.", "I saw him for the last time during the siege. He was just starting for drill with his rifle in his hand. One of the four watercolors which were his last work, stood uncompleted on his easel. There was a shapeless spot at the bottom. He held a handkerchief in his free hand. He moistened this from time to time with saliva and kept tapping away on the spot on the picture. To my great astonishment, almost to my fright, I saw roughed out and finished the head of a lion.", "When the question of publishing Henri Regnault's letters came up, some phrases referring to me and ranking me above my rivals were found in them. The editor of the letter got into communication with me, read me the phrases, and announced that they were to be suppressed, because they might displease the other musicians.", "I knew who the other musicians were, and whose puppet the editor was. It would have been possible, it seems to me, without hurting anyone, to include the exaggerated praise, which, coming from a painter, had no weight, and which would have proved nothing except the great friendship which inspired it. I have always regretted that the public did not learn of the sentiments with which the great artist, whom I loved so much, honored me.", "***** This file should be named 16459-8.txt or 16459-8.zip ***** This and all associated files of various formats will be found in: https://www.gutenberg.org/1/6/4/5/16459/", "Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without permission and without paying copyright royalties.

Their marriage had taken place about a year ago in the States and this was their first visit to England. They had been given a great reception. Every one was prepared to go mad over Mary Marvell, her wonderful clothes, her furs, her jewels, above all one jewel, the great diamond which had been nicknamed, to match its owner, \u201cthe Western Star.\u201d Much, true and untrue, had been written about this famous stone which was reported to be insured for the enormous sum of fifty thousand pounds.", "\u201cYou will probably think me very foolish, Monsieur Poirot, but Lord Cronshaw was telling me last night how wonderfully you cleared up the mystery of his nephew\u2019s death, and I felt that I just must have your advice.

She looked suddenly a good deal older.", "I heard Poirot murmur beneath his breath: \u201cAh, _c\u2019est comme \u00e7a_!\u201d Then he said aloud, with his usual uncanny luck in hitting the bull\u2019s-eye (he dignifies it by the name of psychology): \u201cThen you are without doubt already acquainted with Lady Yardly, or perhaps your husband is?\u201d", "\u201cGregory knew her when she was out West three years ago,\u201d said Miss Marvell. She hesitated a moment, and then added abruptly: \u201cDo either of you ever see _Society Gossip_?\u201d", "\u201cI ask because in this week\u2019s number there is an article on famous jewels, and it\u2019s really very curious\u2014\u2014\u201d She broke off.", "I rose, went to the table at the other side of the room and returned with the paper in question in my hand. She took it from me, found the article, and began to read aloud:", "\u201c. . . Amongst other famous stones may be included the Star of the East, a diamond in the possession of the Yardly family. An ancestor of the present Lord Yardly brought it back with him from China, and a romantic story is said to attach to it. According to this, the stone was once the right eye of a temple god. Another diamond, exactly similar in form and size, formed the left eye, and the story goes that this jewel, too, would in course of time be stolen. \u2018One eye shall go West, the other East, till they shall meet once more. Then, in triumph shall they return to the god.\u2019 It is a curious coincidence that there is at the present time a stone corresponding closely in description with this one, and known as \u2018the Star of the West,\u2019 or \u2018the Western Star.\u2019 It is the property of the celebrated film actress, Miss Mary Marvell. A comparison of the two stones would be interesting.\u201d", "\u201c_\u00c9patant!_\u201d murmured Poirot. \u201cWithout doubt a romance of the first water.\u201d He turned to Mary Marvell. \u201cAnd you are not afraid, madame? You have no superstitious terrors? You do not fear to introduce these two Siamese twins to each other lest a Chinaman should appear and, hey presto! whisk them both back to China?\u201d", "\u201cI don\u2019t believe that Lady Yardly\u2019s diamond is anything like as good a stone as mine,\u201d said Miss Marvell. \u201cAnyway, I\u2019m going to see.\u201d", "What more Poirot would have said I do not know, for at that moment the door flew open, and a splendid-looking man strode into the room. From his crisply curling black head, to the tips of his patent-leather boots, he was a hero fit for romance.", "\u201cI said I\u2019d call round for you, Mary,\u201d said Gregory Rolf, \u201cand here I am. Well, what does Monsieur Poirot say to our little problem? Just one big hoax, same as I do?\u201d", "\u201cHoax or no hoax, Mr. Rolf,\u201d he said dryly, \u201cI have advised Madame your wife not to take the jewel with her to Yardly Chase on Friday.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m with you there, sir. I\u2019ve already said so to Mary. But there! She\u2019s a woman through and through, and I guess she can\u2019t bear to think of another woman outshining her in the jewel line.\u201d", "\u201cAh! _la la_,\u201d he observed, returning. \u201c_Histoire de femmes!_ The good husband, he hit the nail on the head\u2014_tout de m\u00eame_, he was not tactful! Assuredly not.\u201d", "\u201cSo I thought. All the same, there is something curious underneath all this. With your permission, _mon ami_, I will take the air. Await my return, I beg of you. I shall not be long.\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s another lady to see Mr. Poirot, sir. I\u2019ve told her he was out, but she says as how she\u2019ll wait, seeing as she\u2019s come up from the country.\u201d", "In another moment the lady had been ushered in. My heart gave a leap as I recognized her. Lady Yardly\u2019s portrait had figured too often in the Society papers to allow her to remain unknown.", "\u201cDo sit down, Lady Yardly,\u201d I said, drawing forward a chair. \u201cMy friend Poirot is out, but I know for a fact that he\u2019ll be back very shortly.\u201d", "She thanked me and sat down. A very different type, this, from Miss Mary Marvell. Tall, dark, with flashing eyes, and a pale proud face\u2014yet something wistful in the curves of the mouth.", "I felt a desire to rise to the occasion. Why not? In Poirot\u2019s presence I have frequently felt a difficulty\u2014I do not appear at my best. And yet there is no doubt that I, too, possess the deductive sense in a marked degree. I leant forward on a sudden impulse.", "There was no doubt as to my bolt having shot home. She stared at me open-mouthed, all colour banished from her cheeks.", "\u201cShe has just left. As I was saying, if she, as the holder of one of the twin diamonds, has received a mysterious series of warnings, you, as the holder of the other stone, must necessarily have done the same. You see how simple it is? I am right, then, you have received these strange communications also?\u201d", "For a moment she hesitated, as though in doubt whether to trust me or not, then she bowed her head in assent with a little smile.", "\u201cIt all fits in. My letters are the duplicates of hers. It is true that they came by post, but there is a curious perfume impregnating them\u2014something in the nature of joss-stick\u2014that at once suggested the East to me. What does it all mean?\u201d", "\u201cThat is what we must find out. You have the letters with you? We might learn something from the postmarks.\u201d", "\u201cUnfortunately I destroyed them. You understand, at the time I regarded it as some foolish joke. Can it be true that some Chinese gang are really trying to recover the diamonds? It seems too incredible.\u201d", "We went over the facts again and again, but could get no further towards the elucidation of the mystery. At last Lady Yardly rose.", "\u201cI really don\u2019t think I need wait for Monsieur Poirot. You can tell him all this, can\u2019t you? Thank you so much, Mr.\u2014\u2014\u201d", "\u201cOf course! How stupid of me. You\u2019re a friend of the Cavendishes, aren\u2019t you? It was Mary Cavendish who sent me to Monsieur Poirot.\u201d", "When my friend returned, I enjoyed telling him the tale of what had occurred during his absence. He cross-questioned me rather sharply over the details of our conversation and I could read between the lines that he was not best pleased to have been absent. I also fancied that the dear old fellow was just the least inclined to be jealous. It had become rather a pose with him to consistently belittle my abilities, and I think he was chagrined at finding no loophole for criticism. I was secretly rather pleased with myself, though I tried to conceal the fact for fear of irritating him. In spite of his idiosyncrasies, I was deeply attached to my quaint little friend.", "\u201c_Bien!_\u201d he said at length, with a curious look on his face. \u201cThe plot develops. Pass me, I pray you, that \u2018Peerage\u2019 on the top shelf there.\u201d He turned the leaves. \u201cAh, here we are! \u2018Yardly . . . 10th viscount, served South African War\u2019 . . . _tout \u00e7a n\u2019a pas d\u2019importance_ . . . \u2018mar. 1907 Hon. Maude Stopperton, fourth daughter of 3rd Baron Cotteril\u2019 . . . um, um, um, . . . \u2018has iss. two daughters, born 1908, 1910. . . . Clubs . . . residences.\u2019 . . . _Voil\u00e0_, that does not tell us much. But to-morrow morning we see this _milord_!\u201d", "\u201cI am not acting for Miss Marvell since she refuses to be guided by my advice. What I do now is for my own satisfaction\u2014the satisfaction of Hercule Poirot! Decidedly, I must have a finger in this pie.\u201d", "\u201cAnd you calmly wire Lord Yardly to dash up to town just to suit your convenience. He won\u2019t be pleased.\u201d", "\u201cNot now, I pray you. Let us not confuse the mind. And observe that \u2018Peerage\u2019\u2014how you have replaced him! See you not that the tallest books go in the top shelf, the next tallest in the row beneath, and so on. Thus we have order, _method_, which, as I have often told you, Hastings\u2014\u2014\u201d", "Lord Yardly turned out to be a cheery, loud-voiced sportsman with a rather red face, but with a good-humoured bonhomie about him that was distinctly attractive and made up for any lack of mentality.", "\u201cExtraordinary business this, Monsieur Poirot. Can\u2019t make head or tail of it. Seems my wife\u2019s been getting odd kind of letters, and that this Miss Marvell\u2019s had \u2019em too. What does it all mean?\u201d", "\u201cDamned nonsense!\u201d he spluttered. \u201cThere\u2019s never been any romantic story attaching to the diamond. It came from India originally, I believe. I never heard of all this Chinese god stuff.\u201d", "Poirot smiled a little, but made no direct reply. \u201cWhat I would ask you to do, _milord_, is to place yourself in my hands. If you do so unreservedly, I have great hopes of averting the catastrophe.\u201d", "\u201c_Bien!_ Then permit that I ask you a few questions. This affair of Yardly Chase, is it, as you say, all fixed up between you and Mr. Rolf?\u201d", "\u201cOh, he told you about it, did he? No, there\u2019s nothing settled.\u201d He hesitated, the brick-red colour of his face deepening. \u201cMight as well get the thing straight. I\u2019ve made rather an ass of myself in many ways, Monsieur Poirot\u2014and I\u2019m head over ears in debt\u2014but I want to pull up. I\u2019m fond of the kids, and I want to straighten things up, and be able to live on at the old place. Gregory Rolf is offering me big money\u2014enough to set me on my feet again. I don\u2019t want to do it\u2014I hate the thought of all that crowd play-acting round the Chase\u2014but I may have to, unless\u2014\u2014\u201d He broke off.", "Poirot eyed him keenly. \u201cYou have, then, another string to your bow? Permit that I make a guess? It is to sell the Star of the East?\u201d", "Lord Yardly nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s it. It\u2019s been in the family for some generations, but it\u2019s not entailed. Still, it\u2019s not the easiest thing in the world to find a purchaser. Hoffberg, the Hatton Garden man, is on the look-out for a likely customer, but he\u2019ll have to find one soon, or it\u2019s a washout.\u201d", "\u201cOh, she\u2019s bitterly opposed to my selling the jewel. You know what women are. She\u2019s all for this film stunt.\u201d", "\u201cI comprehend,\u201d said Poirot. He remained a moment or so in thought, then rose briskly to his feet. \u201cYou return to Yardly Chase at once? _Bien!_ Say no word to anyone\u2014to _anyone_ mind\u2014but expect us there this evening. We will arrive shortly after five.\u201d", "It was half-past five when we arrived at Yardly Chase, and followed the dignified butler to the old panelled hall with its fire of blazing logs. A pretty picture met our eyes: Lady Yardly and her two children, the mother\u2019s proud dark head bent down over the two fair ones. Lord Yardly stood near, smiling down on them.", "Lady Yardly looked up with a start, her husband came forward uncertainly, his eyes seeking instruction from Poirot. The little man was equal to the occasion.", "\u201cAll my excuses! It is that I investigate still this affair of Miss Marvell\u2019s. She comes to you on Friday, does she not? I make a little tour first to make sure that all is secure. Also I wanted to ask of Lady Yardly if she recollected at all the postmarks on the letters she received?\u201d", "Lady Yardly shook her head regretfully. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t. It is stupid of me. But, you see, I never dreamt of taking them seriously.\u201d", "Poirot permitted himself to be persuaded, and sitting down by Lady Yardly, began to make friends with the children. In a short time they were all romping together, and had dragged me into the game.", "\u201c_Vous \u00eates bonne m\u00e8re_,\u201d said Poirot, with a gallant little bow, as the children were removed reluctantly by a stern nurse.", "A dressing-gong sounded, and we rose to go up to our rooms. At that moment the butler entered with a telegram on a salver which he handed to Lord Yardly. The latter tore it open with a brief word of apology. As he read it he stiffened visibly.", "\u201cJust a minute, Monsieur Poirot. I feel you ought to know about this. It\u2019s from Hoffberg. He thinks he\u2019s found a customer for the diamond\u2014an American, sailing for the States to-morrow. They\u2019re sending down a chap to-night to vet the stone. By Jove, though, if this goes through\u2014\u2014\u201d Words failed him.", "\u201cI wish you wouldn\u2019t sell it, George,\u201d she said, in a low voice. \u201cIt\u2019s been in the family so long.\u201d She waited, as though for a reply, but when none came her face hardened. She shrugged her shoulders. \u201cI must go and dress. I suppose I had better display \u2018the goods.\u2019\u201d She turned to Poirot with a slight grimace. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the most hideous necklaces that was ever designed! George has always promised to have the stones reset for me, but it\u2019s never been done.\u201d She left the room.", "Half an hour later, we three were assembled in the great drawing-room awaiting the lady. It was already a few minutes past the dinner hour.", "Suddenly there was a low rustle, and Lady Yardly appeared framed in the doorway, a radiant figure in a long white shimmering dress. Round the column of her neck was a rivulet of fire. She stood there with one hand just touching the necklace.", "\u201cBehold the sacrifice,\u201d she said gaily. Her ill-humour seemed to have vanished. \u201cWait while I turn the big light on and you shall feast your eyes on the ugliest necklace in England.\u201d", "The switches were just outside the door. As she stretched out her hand to them, the incredible thing happened. Suddenly without any warning, every light was extinguished, the door banged, and from the other side of it came a long-drawn piercing woman\u2019s scream.", "We rushed blindly for the door, cannoning into each other in the darkness. It was some minutes before we could find it. What a sight met our eyes! Lady Yardly lay senseless on the marble floor, a crimson mark on her white throat where the necklace had been wrenched from her neck.", "Lord Yardly sprang up with an oath. I accompanied him, my heart beating wildly. The Chinaman again! The side door in question was a small one in the angle of the wall, not more than a dozen yards from the scene of the tragedy. As we reached it, I gave a cry. There, just short of the threshold, lay the glittering necklace, evidently dropped by the thief in the panic of his flight. I swooped joyously down on it. Then I uttered another cry which Lord Yardly echoed. For in the middle of the necklace was a great gap. The Star of the East was missing!", "As I did so something fluttered to the ground. I picked it up. It was a piece of silk, and the embroidery was unmistakable. It had been torn from a Chinaman\u2019s robe.", "But in vain we hunted and searched. In the pitch darkness of the night, the thief had found it easy to make his getaway. We returned reluctantly, and Lord Yardly sent off one of the footmen post-haste to fetch the police.", "Lady Yardly, aptly ministered to by Poirot, who is as good as a woman in these matters, was sufficiently recovered to be able to tell her story.", "\u201cI was just going to turn on the other light,\u201d she said, \u201cwhen a man sprang on me from behind. He tore my necklace from my neck with such force that I fell headlong to the floor. As I fell I saw him disappearing through the side door. Then I realized by the pig-tail and the embroidered robe that he was a Chinaman.\u201d She stopped with a shudder.", "\u201cWell\u201d\u2014I coughed delicately\u2014\u201cthings haven\u2019t gone very well, have they? I mean, you tell Lord Yardly to place himself in your hands and all will be well\u2014and then the diamond vanishes from under your very nose!\u201d", "\u201cSo, having\u2014pardon the expression\u2014rather made a mess of things, don\u2019t you think it would be more graceful to leave immediately?\u201d", "\u201cDon\u2019t you see?\u201d His unusual obtuseness annoyed me. What had happened to his usually keen wits? \u201cThey\u2019ve got one, now they\u2019ll go for the other.\u201d", "\u201c_Tiens!_\u201d cried Poirot, stepping back a pace and regarding me with admiration. \u201cBut your brain marches to a marvel, my friend! Figure to yourself that for the moment I had not thought of that! But there is plenty of time. The full of the moon, it is not until Friday.\u201d", "I shook my head dubiously. The full of the moon theory left me entirely cold. I had my way with Poirot, however, and we departed immediately, leaving behind us a note of explanation and apology for Lord Yardly.", "My idea was to go at once to the _Magnificent_, and relate to Miss Marvell what had occurred, but Poirot vetoed the plan, and insisted that the morning would be time enough. I gave in rather grudgingly.", "In the morning Poirot seemed strangely disinclined to stir out. I began to suspect that, having made a mistake to start with, he was singularly loath to proceed with the case. In answer to my persuasions, he pointed out, with admirable common sense, that as the details of the affair at Yardly Chase were already in the morning papers the Rolfs would know quite as much as we could tell them. I gave way unwillingly.", "Events proved my forebodings to be justified. About two o\u2019clock, the telephone rang. Poirot answered it. He listened for some moments, then with a brief \u201c_Bien, j\u2019y serai_\u201d he rang off, and turned to me.", "\u201cWhat do you think, _mon ami_?\u201d He looked half ashamed, half excited. \u201cThe diamond of Miss Marvell, it has been stolen.\u201d", "\u201cWhat?\u201d I cried, springing up. \u201cAnd what about the \u2018full of the moon\u2019 now?\u201d Poirot hung his head. \u201cWhen did this happen?\u201d", "\u201cThat \u2018full of the moon\u2019 idea was clever. The whole point of it was to get us to concentrate on the Friday, and so be off our guard beforehand. It is a pity you did not realize that.\u201d", "At the _Magnificent_, we were ushered at once into the manager\u2019s office. Gregory Rolf was there with two men from Scotland Yard. A pale-faced clerk sat opposite them.", "\u201cWe\u2019re getting to the bottom of it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s almost unbelievable. How the guy had the nerve I can\u2019t think.\u201d", "A very few minutes sufficed to give us the facts. Mr. Rolf had gone out of the hotel at 11.15. At 11.30, a gentleman, so like him in appearance as to pass muster, entered the hotel and demanded the jewel-case from the safe deposit. He duly signed the receipt, remarking carelessly as he did so: \u201cLooks a bit different from my ordinary one, but I hurt my hand getting out of the taxi.\u201d The clerk merely smiled and remarked that he saw very little difference. Rolf laughed and said: \u201cWell, don\u2019t run me in as a crook this time, anyway. I\u2019ve been getting threatening letters from a Chinaman, and the worst of it is I look rather like a Chink myself\u2014it\u2019s something about the eyes.\u201d", "\u201cI looked at him,\u201d said the clerk who was telling us this, \u201cand I saw at once what he meant. The eyes slanted up at the corners like an Oriental\u2019s. I\u2019d never noticed it before.\u201d", "\u201cNo, sir,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t say I do.\u201d And indeed there was nothing even remotely Oriental about the frank brown eyes that looked into ours.", "The Scotland Yard man grunted. \u201cBold customer. Thought the eyes might be noticed, and took the bull by the horns to disarm suspicion. He must have watched you out of the hotel, sir, and nipped in as soon as you were well away.\u201d", "Poirot hopped briskly to his feet. \u201cI have not been of much use, I fear,\u201d he said regretfully. \u201cIs it permitted to see Madame?\u201d", "\u201cLord Yardly.\u201d He discounted further inquiries by slipping his arm through mine. \u201cCome, come, _mon ami_. I know all that you feel about this miserable business. I have not distinguished myself! You, in my place, might have distinguished yourself! _Bien!_ All is admitted. Let us forget it and have lunch.\u201d", "It was about four o\u2019clock when we entered Poirot\u2019s rooms. A figure rose from a chair by the window. It was Lord Yardly. He looked haggard and distraught.", "\u201cI got your wire and came up at once. Look here, I\u2019ve been round to Hoffberg, and they know nothing about that man of theirs last night, or the wire either. Do you think that\u2014\u2014\u201d", "\u201cAnd the ruse succeeded,\u201d said Poirot cheerfully. \u201cTherefore, _milord_, I have much pleasure in returning you\u2014this!\u201d With a dramatic gesture he produced a glittering object. It was a great diamond.", "\u201cNo?\u201d said Poirot. \u201cIt makes no matter. Believe me, it was necessary for the diamond to be stolen. I promised you that it should be preserved to you, and I have kept my word. You must permit me to keep my little secret. Convey, I beg of you, the assurances of my deepest respect to Lady Yardly, and tell her how pleased I am to be able to restore her jewel to her. What _beau temps_, is it not? Good day, _milord_.\u201d", "And smiling and talking, the amazing little man conducted the bewildered nobleman to the door. He returned gently rubbing his hands.", "\u201c_Mais oui!_ The warning letters, the Chinaman, the article in _Society Gossip_, all sprang from the ingenious brain of Mr. Rolf! The two diamonds, supposed to be so miraculously alike\u2014bah! they did not exist. There was only _one_ diamond, my friend! Originally in the Yardly collection, for three years it has been in the possession of Mr. Rolf. He stole it this morning with the assistance of a touch of grease paint at the corner of each eye! Ah, I must see him on the film, he is indeed an artist, _celui-l\u00e0_!", "\u201cYou comprehend she was left much alone in California. Her husband was amusing himself elsewhere. Mr. Rolf was handsome, he had an air about him of romance. But _au fond_, he is very business-like, _ce monsieur_! He made love to Lady Yardly, and then he blackmailed her. I taxed the lady with the truth the other night, and she admitted it. She swore that she had only been indiscreet, and I believe her. But, undoubtedly, Rolf had letters of hers that could be twisted to bear a different interpretation. Terrified by the threat of a divorce, and the prospect of being separated from her children, she agreed to all he wished. She had no money of her own, and she was forced to permit him to substitute a paste replica for the real stone. The coincidence of the date of the appearance of \u2018the Western Star\u2019 struck me at once. All goes well. Lord Yardly prepares to range himself\u2014to settle down. And then comes the menace of the possible sale of the diamond. The substitution will be discovered. Without doubt she writes off frantically to Gregory Rolf who has just arrived in England. He soothes her by promising to arrange all\u2014and prepares for a double robbery. In this way he will quiet the lady, who might conceivably tell all to her husband, an affair which would not suit our blackmailer at all, he will have \u00a350,000 insurance money (aha, you had forgotten that!), and he will still have the diamond! At this point I put my finger in the pie. The arrival of a diamond expert is announced. Lady Yardly, as I felt sure she would, immediately arranges a robbery\u2014and does it very well too! But Hercule Poirot, he sees nothing but facts. What happens in actuality? The lady switches off the light, bangs the door, throws the necklace down the passage, and screams. She has already wrenched out the diamond with pliers upstairs\u2014\u2014\u201d", "\u201cI demand pardon, my friend. Her hand concealed the part of it where the gap would have shown. To place a piece of silk in the door beforehand is child\u2019s play! Of course, as soon as Rolf read of the robbery, he arranged his own little comedy. And very well he played it!\u201d", "\u201cI said to him that Lady Yardly had told her husband all, that I was empowered to recover the jewel, and that if it were not immediately handed over proceedings would be taken. Also a few more little lies which occurred to me. He was as wax in my hands!\u201d", "\u201cBah!\u201d said Poirot brutally. \u201cShe has a magnificent advertisement. That is all she cares for, that one! Now the other, she is different. _Bonne m\u00e8re, tr\u00e8s femme!_\u201d", "\u201cYes,\u201d I said doubtfully, hardly sharing Poirot\u2019s views on femininity. \u201cI suppose it was Rolf who sent her the duplicate letters.\u201d", "\u201c_Pas du tout_,\u201d said Poirot briskly. \u201cShe came by the advice of Mary Cavendish to seek my aid in her dilemma. Then she heard that Mary Marvell, whom she knew to be her enemy, had been here, and she changed her mind, jumping at a pretext that _you_, my friend, offered her. A very few questions sufficed to show me that _you_ told her of the letters, not she you! She jumped at the chance your words offered.\u201d", "\u201c_Si, si, mon ami_, it is a pity that you study not the psychology. She told you that the letters were destroyed? Oh, la la, _never_ does a woman destroy a letter if she can avoid it! Not even if it would be more prudent to do so!\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s all very well,\u201d I said, my anger rising, \u201cbut you\u2019ve made a perfect fool of me! From beginning to end! No, it\u2019s all very well to try and explain it away afterwards. There really is a limit!\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m fed up!\u201d I went out, banging the door. Poirot had made an absolute laughing-stock of me. I decided that he needed a sharp lesson. I would let some time elapse before I forgave him. He had encouraged me to make a perfect fool of myself!", "I had been called away from town for a few days, and on my return found Poirot in the act of strapping up his small valise.", "\u201cYes, though I am bound to admit that, on the face of it, the affair does not seem promising. The Northern Union Insurance Company have asked me to investigate the death of a Mr. Maltravers who a few weeks ago insured his life with them for the large sum of fifty thousand pounds.\u201d", "\u201cThere was, of course, the usual suicide clause in the policy. In the event of his committing suicide within a year the premiums would be forfeited. Mr. Maltravers was duly examined by the Company\u2019s own doctor, and although he was a man slightly past the prime of life was passed as being in quite sound health. However, on Wednesday last\u2014the day before yesterday\u2014the body of Mr. Maltravers was found in the grounds of his house in Essex, Marsdon Manor, and the cause of his death is described as some kind of internal h\u00e6morrhage. That in itself would be nothing remarkable, but sinister rumours as to Mr. Maltravers\u2019 financial position have been in the air of late, and the Northern Union have ascertained beyond any possible doubt that the deceased gentleman stood upon the verge of bankruptcy. Now that alters matters considerably. Maltravers had a beautiful young wife, and it is suggested that he got together all the ready money he could for the purpose of paying the premiums on a life insurance for his wife\u2019s benefit, and then committed suicide. Such a thing is not uncommon. In any case, my friend Alfred Wright, who is a director of the Northern Union, has asked me to investigate the facts of the case, but, as I told him, I am not very hopeful of success. If the cause of the death had been heart failure, I should have been more sanguine. Heart failure may always be translated as the inability of the local G.P. to discover what his patient really did die of, but a h\u00e6morrhage seems fairly definite. Still, we can but make some necessary inquiries. Five minutes to pack your bag, Hastings, and we will take a taxi to Liverpool Street.\u201d", "About an hour later, we alighted from a Great Eastern train at the little station of Marsdon Leigh. Inquiries at the station yielded the information that Marsdon Manor was about a mile distant. Poirot decided to walk, and we betook ourselves along the main street.", "\u201cFirst I will call upon the doctor. I have ascertained that there is only one doctor in Marsdon Leigh, Dr. Ralph Bernard. Ah, here we are at his house.\u201d", "The house in question was a kind of superior cottage, standing back a little from the road. A brass plate on the gate bore the doctor\u2019s name. We passed up the path and rang the bell.", "We proved to be fortunate in our call. It was the doctor\u2019s consulting hour, and for the moment there were no patients waiting for him. Dr. Bernard was an elderly man, high-shouldered and stooping, with a pleasant vagueness of manner.", "Poirot introduced himself and explained the purpose of our visit, adding that Insurance Companies were bound to investigate fully in a case of this kind.", "\u201cOf course, of course,\u201d said Dr. Bernard vaguely. \u201cI suppose, as he was such a rich man, his life was insured for a big sum?\u201d", "\u201cWas he not? He kept two cars, you know, and Marsdon Manor is a pretty big place to keep up, although I believe he bought it very cheap.\u201d", "\u201cIs that so? Indeed. It is fortunate for his wife, then, that there is this life insurance. A very beautiful and charming young creature, but terribly unstrung by this sad catastrophe. A mass of nerves, poor thing. I have tried to spare her all I can, but of course the shock was bound to be considerable.\u201d", "\u201cYes, the body had not been touched. He was lying at the edge of a small plantation. He had evidently been out shooting rooks, a small rook rifle lay beside him. The h\u00e6morrhage must have occurred quite suddenly. Gastric ulcer, without a doubt.\u201d", "\u201cI demand pardon,\u201d said Poirot humbly. \u201cBut, if my memory is not at fault, in the case of a recent murder, the doctor first gave a verdict of heart failure\u2014altering it when the local constable pointed out that there was a bullet wound through the head!\u201d", "\u201cYou will not find any bullet wounds on the body of Mr. Maltravers,\u201d said Dr. Bernard dryly. \u201cNow, gentlemen, if there is nothing further\u2014\u2014\u201d", "\u201cGood morning, and many thanks to you, doctor, for so kindly answering our questions. By the way, you saw no need for an autopsy?\u201d", "\u201cCertainly not.\u201d The doctor became quite apoplectic. \u201cThe cause of death was clear, and in my profession we see no need to distress unduly the relatives of a dead patient.\u201d", "\u201cAnd what do you think of Dr. Bernard, Hastings?\u201d inquired Poirot, as we proceeded on our way to the Manor.", "I glanced at him uneasily, but he seemed perfectly serious. A twinkle, however, came into his eye, and he added slyly:", "On our arrival at the manor-house, the door was opened to us by a middle-aged parlourmaid. Poirot handed her his card, and a letter from the Insurance Company for Mrs. Maltravers. She showed us into a small morning-room, and retired to tell her mistress. About ten minutes elapsed, and then the door opened, and a slender figure in widow\u2019s weeds stood upon the threshold.", "\u201cMadame!\u201d Poirot sprang gallantly to his feet and hastened towards her. \u201cI cannot tell you how I regret to derange you in this way. But what will you? _Les affaires_\u2014they know no mercy.\u201d", "Mrs. Maltravers permitted him to lead her to a chair. Her eyes were red with weeping, but the temporary disfigurement could not conceal her extraordinary beauty. She was about twenty-seven or eight, and very fair, with large blue eyes and a pretty pouting mouth.", "\u201cCourage, my dear Madame. Courage! You see, your late husband insured his life for rather a large sum, and in such a case the Company always has to satisfy itself as to a few details. They have empowered me to act for them. You can rest assured that I will do all in my power to render the matter not too unpleasant for you. Will you recount to me briefly the sad events of Wednesday?\u201d", "\u201cI was changing for tea when my maid came up\u2014one of the gardeners had just run to the house. He had found\u2014\u2014\u201d", "\u201cNot since lunch. I had walked down to the village for some stamps, and I believe he was out pottering round the grounds.\u201d", "\u201cYes, he usually took his little rook rifle with him, and I heard one or two shots in the distance.\u201d", "She led the way out of the room and found and handed the little weapon to Poirot, who examined it cursorily.", "The parlourmaid, summoned, led Poirot upstairs. I remained with the lovely and unfortunate woman. It was hard to know whether to speak or remain silent. I essayed one or two general reflections to which she responded absently, and in a very few minutes Poirot rejoined us.", "\u201cI thank you for all your courtesy, madame. I do not think you need be troubled any further with this matter. By the way, do you know anything of your husband\u2019s financial position?\u201d", "\u201cI see. Then you can give us no clue as to why he suddenly decided to insure his life? He had not done so previously, I understand.\u201d", "\u201cWell, we had only been married a little over a year. But, as to why he insured his life, it was because he had absolutely made up his mind that he would not live long. He had a strong premonition of his own death. I gather that he had had one h\u00e6morrhage already, and that he knew that another one would prove fatal. I tried to dispel these gloomy fears of his, but without avail. Alas, he was only too right!\u201d", "Tears in her eyes, she bade us a dignified farewell. Poirot made a characteristic gesture as we walked down the drive together.", "\u201c_Eh bien_, that is that! Back to London, my friend, there appears to be no mouse in this mouse-hole. And yet\u2014\u2014\u201d", "\u201cA slight discrepancy, that is all! You noticed it? You did not? Still, life is full of discrepancies, and assuredly the man cannot have taken his own life\u2014there is no poison that would fill his mouth with blood. No, no, I must resign myself to the fact that all here is clear and above-board\u2014but who is this?\u201d", "A tall young man was striding up the drive towards us. He passed us without making any sign, but I noted that he was not ill-looking, with a lean, deeply bronzed face that spoke of life in a tropic clime. A gardener who was sweeping up leaves had paused for a minute in his task, and Poirot ran quickly up to him.", "\u201cI don\u2019t remember his name, sir, though I did hear it. He was staying down here last week for a night. Tuesday, it was.\u201d", "We hastened up the drive after the retreating figure. A glimpse of a black-robed figure on the terrace at the side of the house, and our quarry swerved and we after him, so that we were witnesses of the meeting.", "\u201cI got some news from my lawyers that detained me,\u201d explained the young man. \u201cMy old uncle in Scotland died unexpectedly and left me some money. Under the circumstances I thought it better to cancel my passage. Then I saw this bad news in the paper and I came down to see if there was anything I could do. You\u2019ll want some one to look after things for you a bit perhaps.\u201d", "At that moment they became aware of our presence. Poirot stepped forward, and with many apologies explained that he had left his stick in the hall. Rather reluctantly, it seemed to me, Mrs. Maltravers made the necessary introduction.", "A few minutes\u2019 chat ensued, in the course of which Poirot elicited the fact that Captain Black was putting up at the Anchor Inn. The missing stick not having been discovered (which was not surprising), Poirot uttered more apologies and we withdrew.", "\u201cHere we establish ourselves until our friend the Captain returns,\u201d he explained. \u201cYou notice that I emphasized the point that we were returning to London by the first train? Possibly you thought I meant it. But no\u2014you observed Mrs. Maltravers\u2019 face when she caught sight of this young Black? She was clearly taken aback, and he\u2014_eh bien_, he was very devoted, did you not think so? And he was here on Tuesday night\u2014the day before Mr. Maltravers died. We must investigate the doings of Captain Black, Hastings.\u201d", "In about half an hour we espied our quarry approaching the inn. Poirot went out and accosted him and presently brought him up to the room we had engaged.", "\u201cI have been telling Captain Black of the mission which brings us here,\u201d he explained. \u201cYou can understand, _monsieur le capitaine_, that I am anxious to arrive at Mr. Maltravers\u2019 state of mind immediately before his death, and that at the same time I do not wish to distress Mrs. Maltravers unduly by asking her painful questions. Now, you were here just before the occurrence, and can give us equally valuable information.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019ll do anything I can to help you, I\u2019m sure,\u201d replied the young soldier; \u201cbut I\u2019m afraid I didn\u2019t notice anything out of the ordinary. You see, although Maltravers was an old friend of my people\u2019s, I didn\u2019t know him very well myself.\u201d", "\u201cTuesday afternoon. I went up to town early Wednesday morning, as my boat sailed from Tilbury about twelve o\u2019clock. But some news I got made me alter my plans, as I dare say you heard me explain to Mrs. Maltravers.\u201d", "\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know. The usual odd topics. Maltravers asked after my people, and then we discussed the question of German reparations, and then Mrs. Maltravers asked a lot of questions about East Africa, and I told them one or two yarns, that\u2019s about all, I think.\u201d", "Poirot was silent for a moment, then he said gently: \u201cWith your permission, I should like to try a little experiment. You have told us all that your conscious self knows, I want now to question your subconscious self.\u201d", "\u201cOh, no,\u201d said Poirot reassuringly. \u201cYou see, it is like this, I give you a word, you answer with another, and so on. Any word, the first one you think of. Shall we begin?\u201d", "\u201cNote down the words, please, Hastings,\u201d said Poirot. Then he took from his pocket his big turnip-faced watch and laid it on the table beside him. \u201cWe will commence. Day.\u201d", "\u201cAnd now, Hastings,\u201d said Poirot, smiling at me as the door closed behind him. \u201cYou see it all, do you not?\u201d", "\u201cI will assist you. To begin with, Black answered well within the normal time limit, with no pauses, so we can take it that he himself has no guilty knowledge to conceal. \u2018Day\u2019 to \u2018Night\u2019 and \u2018Place\u2019 to \u2018Name\u2019 are normal associations. I began work with \u2018Bernard\u2019 which might have suggested the local doctor had he come across him at all. Evidently he had not. After our recent conversation, he gave \u2018Dinner\u2019 to my \u2018Tuesday,\u2019 but \u2018Journey\u2019 and \u2018Country\u2019 were answered by \u2018Ship\u2019 and \u2018Uganda,\u2019 showing clearly that it was his journey abroad that was important to him and not the one which brought him down here. \u2018Story\u2019 recalls to him one of the \u2018Lion\u2019 stories he told at dinner. I proceed to \u2018Rook Rifle\u2019 and he answered with the totally unexpected word \u2018Farm.\u2019 When I say \u2018Shot,\u2019 he answers at once \u2018Suicide.\u2019 The association seems clear. A man he knows committed suicide with a rook rifle on a farm somewhere. Remember, too, that his mind is still on the stories he told at dinner, and I think you will agree that I shall not be far from the truth if I recall Captain Black and ask him to repeat the particular suicide story which he told at the dinner-table on Tuesday evening.\u201d", "\u201cYes, I did tell them that story now that I come to think of it. Chap shot himself on a farm out there. Did it with a rook rifle through the roof of the mouth, bullet lodged in the brain. Doctors were no end puzzled over it\u2014there was nothing to show except a little blood on the lips. But what\u2014\u2014\u201d", "\u201cWhat has it got to do with Mr. Maltravers? You did not know, I see, that he was found with a rook rifle by his side.\u201d", "\u201cDo not distress yourself\u2014it would have been one way or another. Well, I must get on the telephone to London.\u201d", "Poirot had a lengthy conversation over the wire, and came back thoughtful. He went off by himself in the afternoon, and it was not till seven o\u2019clock that he announced that he could put it off no longer, but must break the news to the young widow. My sympathy had already gone out to her unreservedly. To be left penniless, and with the knowledge that her husband had killed himself to assure her future was a hard burden for any woman to bear. I cherished a secret hope, however, that young Black might prove capable of consoling her after her first grief had passed. He evidently admired her enormously.", "Our interview with the lady was painful. She refused vehemently to believe the facts that Poirot advanced, and when she was at last convinced broke down into bitter weeping. An examination of the body turned our suspicions into certainty. Poirot was very sorry for the poor lady, but, after all, he was employed by the Insurance Company, and what could he do? As he was preparing to leave he said gently to Mrs. Maltravers:", "\u201cMadame, I have seen some strange things. You know that they say in the village that this house is haunted?\u201d", "We accepted gratefully, and I felt that our presence could not but help distract her a little from her own griefs.", "We had just finished our soup, when there was a scream outside the door, and the sound of breaking crockery. We jumped up. The parlourmaid appeared, her hand to her heart.", "I saw Mrs. Maltravers give a terrified start, and my mind flew to the old superstition that a suicide cannot rest. She thought of it too, I am sure, for a minute later, she caught Poirot\u2019s arm with a scream.", "\u201cDidn\u2019t you hear that? Those three taps on the window? That\u2019s how _he_ always used to tap when he passed round the house.\u201d", "But a sort of terror was gaining on us all. The parlourmaid was obviously unstrung, and when the meal was over Mrs. Maltravers besought Poirot not to go at once. She was clearly terrified to be left alone. We sat in the little morning-room. The wind was getting up, and moaning round the house in an eerie fashion. Twice the door of the room came unlatched and the door slowly opened, and each time she clung to me with a terrified gasp.", "Poirot angrily at last. He got up and shut it once more, then turned the key in the lock. \u201cI shall lock it, so!\u201d", "And even as she spoke the impossible happened. The locked door slowly swung open. I could not see into the passage from where I sat, but she and Poirot were facing it. She gave one long shriek as she turned to him.", "Suddenly, without any warning, the lights quivered and went out. Out of the darkness came three loud raps. I could hear Mrs. Maltravers moaning.", "The man I had seen on the bed upstairs stood there facing us, gleaming with a faint ghostly light. There was blood on his lips, and he held his right hand out, pointing. Suddenly a brilliant light seemed to proceed from it. It passed over Poirot and me, and fell on Mrs. Maltravers. I saw her white terrified face, and something else!", "\u201cBlood,\u201d she cried hysterically. \u201cYes, it\u2019s blood. I killed him. I did it. He was showing me, and then I put my hand on the trigger and pressed. Save me from him\u2014save me! he\u2019s come back!\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d he continued. \u201cYou heard, Hastings? And you, Everett? Oh, by the way, this is Mr. Everett, rather a fine member of the theatrical profession. I \u2019phoned to him this afternoon. His make-up is good, isn\u2019t it? Quite like the dead man, and with a pocket torch and the necessary phosphorescence he made the proper impression. I shouldn\u2019t touch her right hand if I were you, Hastings. Red paint marks so. When the lights went out I clasped her hand, you see. By the way, we mustn\u2019t miss our train. Inspector Japp is outside the window. A bad night\u2014but he has been able to while away the time by tapping on the window every now and then.\u201d", "\u201cYou see,\u201d continued Poirot, as we walked briskly through the wind and rain, \u201cthere was a little discrepancy. The doctor seemed to think the deceased was a Christian Scientist, and who could have given him that impression but Mrs. Maltravers? But to us she represented him as being in a grave state of apprehension about his own health. Again, why was she so taken aback by the reappearance of young Black? And lastly, although I know that convention decrees that a woman must make a decent pretence of mourning for her husband, I do not care for such heavily-rouged eyelids! You did not observe them, Hastings? No? As I always tell you, you see nothing!\u201d", "\u201cWell, there it was. There were the two possibilities. Did Black\u2019s story suggest an ingenious method of committing suicide to Mr. Maltravers, or did his other listener, the wife, see an equally ingenious method of committing murder? I inclined to the latter view. To shoot himself in the way indicated, he would probably have had to pull the trigger with his toe\u2014or at least so I imagine. Now if Maltravers had been found with one boot off, we should almost certainly have heard of it from some one. An odd detail like that would have been remembered.", "\u201cNo, as I say, I inclined to the view that it was a case of murder, not suicide, but I realized that I had not a shadow of proof in support of my theory. Hence the elaborate little comedy you saw played to-night.\u201d", "\u201cLet us start from the beginning. Here is a shrewd and scheming woman who, knowing of her husband\u2019s financial _d\u00e9b\u00e2cle_ and tired of the elderly mate she has only married for his money, induces him to insure his life for a large sum, and then seeks for the means to accomplish her purpose. An accident gives her that\u2014the young soldier\u2019s strange story. The next afternoon when _monsieur le capitaine_, as she thinks, is on the high seas, she and her husband are strolling round the grounds. \u2018What a curious story that was last night!\u2019 she observes. \u2018Could a man shoot himself in such a way? Do show me if it is possible!\u2019 The poor fool\u2014he shows her. He places the end of the rifle in his mouth. She stoops down, and puts her finger on the trigger, laughing up at him. \u2018And now, sir,\u2019 she says saucily, \u2018supposing I pull the trigger?\u2019", "So far, in the cases which I have recorded, Poirot\u2019s investigations have started from the central fact, whether murder or robbery, and have proceeded from thence by a process of logical deduction to the final triumphant unravelling. In the events I am now about to chronicle, a remarkable chain of circumstances led from the apparently trivial incidents which first attracted Poirot\u2019s attention to the sinister happenings which completed a most unusual case.", "I had been spending the evening with an old friend of mine, Gerald Parker. There had been, perhaps, about half a dozen people there besides my host and myself, and the talk fell, as it was bound to do sooner or later wherever Parker found himself, on the subject of house-hunting in London. Houses and flats were Parker\u2019s special hobby. Since the end of the War, he had occupied at least half a dozen different flats and maisonnettes. No sooner was he settled anywhere than he would light unexpectedly upon a new find, and would forthwith depart bag and baggage. His moves were nearly always accomplished at a slight pecuniary gain, for he had a shrewd business head, but it was sheer love of the sport that actuated him, and not a desire to make money at it. We listened to Parker for some time with the respect of the novice for the expert. Then it was our turn, and a perfect babel of tongues was let loose. Finally the floor was left to Mrs. Robinson, a charming little bride who was there with her husband. I had never met them before, as Robinson was only a recent acquaintance of Parker\u2019s.", "\u201cTalking of flats,\u201d she said, \u201chave you heard of our piece of luck, Mr. Parker? We\u2019ve got a flat\u2014at last! In Montagu Mansions.\u201d", "\u201cBut\u2014but Montagu Mansions is just off Knightsbridge, isn\u2019t it? Big handsome building. Or are you talking of a poor relation of the same name stuck in the slums somewhere?\u201d", "\u201cN-o.\u201d Mrs. Robinson appeared far from convinced. \u201cBut there were several things about it all that struck me as\u2014well, queer.\u201d", "\u201cAh,\u201d said Parker, \u201cour criminal expert\u2019s attention is aroused! Unburden yourself to him, Mrs. Robinson. Hastings is a great unraveller of mysteries.\u201d", "\u201cOh, not really queer, Captain Hastings, but when we went to the agents, Stosser and Paul\u2014we hadn\u2019t tried them before because they only have the expensive Mayfair flats, but we thought at any rate it would do no harm\u2014everything they offered us was four and five hundred a year, or else huge premiums, and then, just as we were going, they mentioned that they had a flat at eighty, but that they doubted if it would be any good our going there, because it had been on their books some time and they had sent so many people to see it that it was almost sure to be taken\u2014\u2018snapped up\u2019 as the clerk put it\u2014only people were so tiresome in not letting them know, and then they went on sending, and people get annoyed at being sent to a place that had, perhaps, been let some time.\u201d", "Mrs. Robinson paused for some much needed breath, and then continued: \u201cWe thanked him, and said that we quite understood it would probably be no good, but that we should like an order all the same\u2014just in case. And we went there straight away in a taxi, for, after all, you never know. No. 4 was on the second floor, and just as we were waiting for the lift, Elsie Ferguson\u2014she\u2019s a friend of mine, Captain Hastings, and they are looking for a flat too\u2014came hurrying down the stairs. \u2018Ahead of you for once, my dear,\u2019 she said. \u2018But it\u2019s no good. It\u2019s already let.\u2019 That seemed to finish it, but\u2014well, as John said, the place was very cheap, we could afford to give more, and perhaps if we offered a premium.\u2014\u2014A horrid thing to do, of course, and I feel quite ashamed of telling you, but you know what flat-hunting is.\u201d", "I assured her that I was well aware that in the struggle for house-room the baser side of human nature frequently triumphed over the higher, and that the well-known rule of dog eat dog always applied.", "\u201cSo we went up and, would you believe it, the flat wasn\u2019t let at all. We were shown over it by the maid, and then we saw the mistress, and the thing was settled then and there. Immediate possession and fifty pounds for the furniture. We signed the agreement next day, and we are to move in to-morrow!\u201d Mrs. Robinson paused triumphantly.", "The whole thing was rather amusing, and I propounded the thing as a mock problem to Poirot on the following morning. He seemed interested, and questioned me rather narrowly as to the rents of flats in various localities.", "When he returned, about an hour later, his eyes were gleaming with a peculiar excitement. He laid his stick on the table, and brushed the nap of his hat with his usual tender care before he spoke.", "\u201cIt is as well, _mon ami_, that we have no affairs of moment on hand. We can devote ourselves wholly to the present investigation.\u201d", "\u201cI am most serious. Figure to yourself, my friend, that the real rent of those flats is \u00a3350. I have just ascertained that from the landlord\u2019s agents. And yet this particular flat is being sublet at eighty pounds! Why?\u201d", "\u201cThen again how curious it is that her friend tells her the flat is let, and, when she goes up, behold, it is not so at all!\u201d", "\u201cBut surely you agree with me that the other woman must have gone to the wrong flat. That is the only possible solution.\u201d", "\u201cYou may or may not be right on that point, Hastings. The fact still remains that numerous other applicants were sent to see it, and yet, in spite of its remarkable cheapness, it was still in the market when Mrs. Robinson arrived.\u201d", "\u201cMrs. Robinson did not seem to notice anything amiss. Very curious, is it not? Did she impress you as being a truthful woman, Hastings?\u201d", "\u201cYes, there are hundreds of these average men\u2014and, anyway, you bring more sympathy and appreciation to your description of women. Do you know anything about these people? Does Parker know them well.\u201d", "\u201c_Tout doucement, mon ami_. Have I said that I think anything? All I say is\u2014it is a curious story. And there is nothing to throw light upon it; except perhaps the lady\u2019s name, eh, Hastings?\u201d", "\u201cAnd stars give light! _Voil\u00e0!_ Calm yourself, Hastings. Do not put on that air of injured dignity. Come, we will go to Montagu Mansions and make a few inquiries.\u201d", "I accompanied him, nothing loath. The Mansions were a handsome block of buildings in excellent repair. A uniformed porter was sunning himself on the threshold, and it was to him that Poirot addressed himself:", "The porter was a man of few words and apparently of a sour or suspicious disposition. He hardly looked at us and grunted out:", "Poirot had steered his way into Brompton Road before I asked him what he was going to do and where we were going.", "\u201cTo the house agents, Hastings. I have a great desire to have a flat in Montagu Mansions. If I am not mistaken, several interesting things will take place there before long.\u201d", "We were fortunate in our quest. No. 8, on the fourth floor, was to be let furnished at ten guineas a week. Poirot promptly took it for a month. Outside in the street again, he silenced my protests:", "\u201cBut I make money nowadays! Why should I not indulge a whim? By the way, Hastings, have you a revolver?\u201d", "\u201cThat you will need it? It is quite possible. The idea pleases you, I see. Always the spectacular and romantic appeals to you.\u201d", "The following day saw us installed in our temporary home. The flat was pleasantly furnished. It occupied the same position in the building as that of the Robinsons, but was two floors higher.", "The day after our installation was a Sunday. In the afternoon, Poirot left the front door ajar, and summoned me hastily as a bang reverberated from somewhere below.", "About half an hour later, a young woman emerged in brilliant and varied clothing. With a sigh of satisfaction, Poirot tiptoed back into the flat.", "\u201cWe are about to descend after the method of the dustbins,\u201d he explained cheerfully. \u201cNo one will observe us. The Sunday concert, the Sunday \u2018afternoon out,\u2019 and finally the Sunday nap after the Sunday dinner of England\u2014_le rosbif_\u2014all these will distract attention from the doings of Hercule Poirot. Come, my friend.\u201d", "Pulling on the rope, we descended slowly till we reached the second floor. Poirot uttered an exclamation of satisfaction as he perceived that the wooden door into the scullery was open.", "\u201cYou observe? Never do they bolt these doors in the daytime. And yet anyone could mount or descend as we have done. At night yes\u2014though not always then\u2014and it is against that that we are going to make provision.\u201d", "He had drawn some tools from his pocket as he spoke, and at once set deftly to work, his object being to arrange the bolt so that it could be pulled back from the lift. The operation only occupied about three minutes. Then Poirot returned the tools to his pocket, and we reascended once more to our own domain.", "On Monday Poirot was out all day, but when he returned in the evening he flung himself into his chair with a sigh of satisfaction.", "\u201cHastings, shall I recount to you a little history? A story after your own heart and which will remind you of your favourite cinema?\u201d", "\u201cIt is true enough. Inspector Japp of Scotland Yard will vouch for its accuracy, since it was through his kind offices that it came to my ears. Listen, Hastings. A little over six months ago some important Naval plans were stolen from an American Government department. They showed the position of some of the most important Harbour defences, and would be worth a considerable sum to any foreign Government\u2014that of Japan, for example. Suspicion fell upon a young man named Luigi Valdarno, an Italian by birth, who was employed in a minor capacity in the Department and who was missing at the same time as the papers. Whether Luigi Valdarno was the thief or not, he was found two days later on the East Side in New York, shot dead. The papers were not on him. Now for some time past Luigi Valdarno had been going about with a Miss Elsa Hardt, a young concert singer who had recently appeared and who lived with a brother in an apartment in Washington. Nothing was known of the antecedents of Miss Elsa Hardt, and she disappeared suddenly about the time of Valdarno\u2019s death. There are reasons for believing that she was in reality an accomplished international spy who has done much nefarious work under various _aliases_. The American Secret Service, whilst doing their best to trace her, also kept an eye upon certain insignificant Japanese gentlemen living in Washington. They felt pretty certain that, when Elsa Hardt had covered her tracks sufficiently, she would approach the gentlemen in question. One of them left suddenly for England a fortnight ago. On the face of it, therefore, it would seem that Elsa Hardt is in England.\u201d Poirot paused, and then added softly: \u201cThe official description of Elsa Hardt is: Height 5 ft. 7, eyes blue, hair auburn, fair complexion, nose straight, no special distinguishing marks.\u201d", "\u201cWell, there is a chance of it, anyhow,\u201d amended Poirot. \u201cAlso, I learn that a swarthy man, a foreigner of some kind, was inquiring about the occupants of No. 4 only this morning. Therefore, _mon ami_, I fear that you must forswear your beauty sleep to-night, and join me in my all-night vigil in the flat below\u2014armed with that excellent revolver of yours, _bien entendu_!\u201d", "At twelve o\u2019clock precisely, we crept cautiously into the coal-lift and lowered ourselves to the second floor. Under Poirot\u2019s manipulation, the wooden door quickly swung inwards, and we climbed into the flat. From the scullery we passed into the kitchen where we established ourselves comfortably in two chairs with the door into the hall ajar.", "To me, the waiting appeared endless. I was terrified of going to sleep. Just when it seemed to me that I had been there about eight hours\u2014and had, as I found out afterwards, in reality been exactly one hour and twenty minutes\u2014a faint scratching sound came to my ears. Poirot\u2019s hand touched mine. I rose, and together we moved carefully in the direction of the hall. The noise came from there. Poirot placed his lips to my ear.", "\u201cOutside the front door. They are cutting out the lock. When I give the word, not before, fall upon him from behind and hold him fast. Be careful, he will have a knife.\u201d", "Presently there was a rending sound, and a little circle of light appeared through the door. It was extinguished immediately and then the door was slowly opened. Poirot and I flattened ourselves against the wall. I heard a man\u2019s breathing as he passed us. Then he flashed on his torch, and as he did so, Poirot hissed in my ear:", "We sprang together, Poirot with a quick movement enveloped the intruder\u2019s head with a light woollen scarf whilst I pinioned his arms. The whole affair was quick and noiseless. I twisted a dagger from his hand, and as Poirot brought down the scarf from his eyes, whilst keeping it wound tightly round his mouth, I jerked up my revolver where he could see it and understand that resistance was useless. As he ceased to struggle Poirot put his mouth close to his ear and began to whisper rapidly. After a minute the man nodded. Then enjoining silence with a movement of the hand, Poirot led the way out of the flat and down the stairs. Our captive followed, and I brought up the rear with the revolver. When we were out in the street, Poirot turned to me.", "I returned in a minute with the waiting taxi. The scarf had been unwound from the stranger\u2019s face, and I gave a start of surprise.", "\u201cObservation was always your strong point, Hastings! Nothing escapes you. No, the man is not a Jap. He is an Italian.\u201d", "We got into the taxi, and Poirot gave the driver an address in St. John\u2019s Wood. I was by now completely fogged. I did not like to ask Poirot where we were going in front of our captive, and strove in vain to obtain some light upon the proceedings.", "We alighted at the door of a small house standing back from the road. A returning wayfarer, slightly drunk, was lurching along the pavement and almost collided with Poirot, who said something sharply to him which I did not catch. All three of us went up the steps of the house. Poirot rang the bell and motioned us to stand a little aside. There was no answer and he rang again and then seized the knocker which he plied for some minutes vigorously.", "The man prepared to shut the door, but Poirot thrust his foot in adroitly. He became suddenly a perfect caricature of an infuriated Frenchman.", "\u201cWhat you say, there is no doctor? I will have the law of you. You must come! I will stay here and ring and knock all night.\u201d", "\u201cMy dear sir\u2014\u2014\u201d The door was opened again, the man, clad in a dressing-gown and slippers, stepped forward to pacify Poirot with an uneasy glance round.", "With a neat push Poirot sent him staggering down the steps. In another minute all three of us were inside the door and it was pushed to and bolted.", "\u201cQuick\u2014in here.\u201d Poirot led the way into the nearest room switching on the light as he did so. \u201cAnd you\u2014behind the curtain.\u201d", "\u201cSi, signor,\u201d said the Italian and slid rapidly behind the full folds of rose-coloured velvet which draped the embrasure of the window.", "Not a minute too soon. Just as he disappeared from view a woman rushed into the room. She was tall with reddish hair and held a scarlet kimono round her slender form.", "\u201cIt is to be hoped your husband will not suffer from a chill. I observed that he had slippers on his feet, and that his dressing-gown was a warm one.\u201d", "\u201cIt is true that none of us have the pleasure of your acquaintance, madame. It is especially to be regretted as one of our number has come specially from New York in order to meet you.\u201d", "The curtains parted and the Italian stepped out. To my horror I observed that he was brandishing my revolver, which Poirot must doubtless have put down through inadvertence in the cab.", "The woman gave a piercing scream and turned to fly, but Poirot was standing in front of the closed door.", "\u201cWho was it dat croaked Luigi Valdarno?\u201d asked the Italian hoarsely, brandishing the weapon, and sweeping each one of us with it. We dared not move.", "\u201cYou will oblige me by refraining from talking so much, Hastings. I can assure you that our friend will not shoot until I give the word.\u201d", "With a swift movement, the woman snatched up a big black velvet cat which served as a cover for the telephone.", "\u201cClever,\u201d murmured Poirot appreciatively. He stood aside from the door. \u201cGood evening, madame. I will detain your friend from New York whilst you make your getaway.\u201d", "\u201cWhatta fool!\u201d roared the big Italian, and raising the revolver he fired point-blank at the woman\u2019s retreating figure just as I flung myself upon him.", "\u201cNever will you trust your old friend, Hastings. I do not care for my friends to carry loaded pistols about with them and never would I permit a mere acquaintance to do so. No, no, _mon ami_.\u201d This to the Italian who swearing hoarsely. Poirot continued to address him in a tone of mild reproof: \u201cSee now, what I have done for you. I have saved you from being hanged. And do not think that our beautiful lady will escape. No, no, the house is watched, back and front. Straight into the arms of the police they will go. Is not that a beautiful and consoling thought? Yes, you may leave the room now. But be careful\u2014be very careful. I\u2014\u2014Ah, he is gone! And my friend Hastings looks at me with eyes of reproach. But it was all so simple! It was clear, from the first, that out of several hundred, probably, applicants for No. 4, Montagu Mansions only the Robinsons were considered suitable. Why? What was there that singled them out from the rest\u2014at practically a glance. Their appearance? Possibly, but it was not so unusual. Their name, then!\u201d", "\u201cAh! _Sapristi_, but exactly! That was the point. Elsa Hardt and her husband, or brother or whatever he really is, come from New York, and take a flat in the name of Mr. and Mrs. Robinson. Suddenly they learn that one of these secret societies, the Mafia, or the Camorra, to which doubtless Luigi Valdarno belonged, is on their track. What do they do? They hit on a scheme of transparent simplicity. Evidently they knew that their pursuers were not personally acquainted with either of them. What then can be simpler? They offer the flat at an absurdly low rental. Of the thousands of young couples in London looking for flats, there cannot fail to be several Robinsons. It is only a matter of waiting. If you will look at the name of Robinson in the telephone directory, you will realize that a fair-haired Mrs. Robinson was pretty sure to come along sooner or later. Then what will happen? The avenger arrives. He knows the name, he knows the address. He strikes! All is over, vengeance is satisfied, and Miss Elsa Hardt has escaped by the skin of her teeth once more. By the way, Hastings, you must present me to the real Mrs. Robinson\u2014that delightful and truthful creature! What will they think when they find their flat has been broken into! We must hurry back. Ah, that sounds like Japp and his friends arriving.\u201d", "\u201cHow did you know this address?\u201d I asked as I followed Poirot out into the hall. \u201cOh, of course, you had the first Mrs. Robinson followed when she left the other flat.\u201d", "\u201cOh, it\u2019s only Monsieur Poirot at one of his little jokes!\u201d he exclaimed, as Poirot\u2019s head followed that of the cat. \u201cLet us in, moosior.\u201d", "\u201cI see. So you come to search. Well, I am about to depart with Hastings, but I should like to give you a little lecture upon the history and habits of the domestic cat.\u201d", "\u201cThe cat,\u201d declaimed Poirot, \u201cwas worshipped by the ancient Egyptians. It is still regarded as a symbol of good luck if a black cat crosses your path. This cat crossed your path to-night, Japp. To speak of the interior of any animal or any person is not, I know, considered polite in England. But the interior of this cat is perfectly delicate. I refer to the lining.\u201d", "\u201cOh, I forgot to introduce you,\u201d said Japp. \u201cMr. Poirot, this is Mr. Burt of the United States Secret Service.\u201d", "The American\u2019s trained fingers had felt what he was looking for. He held out his hand, and for a moment speech failed him. Then he rose to the occasion.", "Coming from a convalescent influenza patient, I hailed the remark as showing a beneficial optimism. I myself had been the first sufferer from the disease. Poirot in his turn had gone down. He was now sitting up in bed, propped up with pillows, his head muffled in a woollen shawl, and was slowly sipping a particularly noxious tisane which I had prepared according to his directions. His eye rested with pleasure upon a neatly graduated row of medicine bottles which adorned the mantelpiece.", "\u201cYes, yes,\u201d my little friend continued. \u201cOnce more shall I be myself again, the great Hercule Poirot, the terror of evil-doers! Figure to yourself, _mon ami_, that I have a little paragraph to myself in _Society Gossip_. But yes! Here it is! \u2018Go it\u2014criminals\u2014all out! Hercule Poirot\u2014and believe me, girls, he\u2019s some Hercules!\u2014our own pet society detective can\u2019t get a grip on you. \u2019Cause why? \u2019Cause he\u2019s got _la grippe_ himself\u2019!\u201d", "\u201cGood for you, Poirot. You are becoming quite a public character. And fortunately you haven\u2019t missed anything of particular interest during this time.\u201d", "\u201cThere\u2019s a gentleman downstairs. Says he must see Monsieur Poirot or you, Captain. Seeing as he was in a great to-do\u2014and with all that quite the gentleman\u2014I brought up \u2019is card.\u201d", "Poirot motioned with his head towards the bookcase, and I obediently pulled forth \u201cWho\u2019s Who.\u201d Poirot took it from me and scanned the pages rapidly.", "\u201cH\u2019m!\u201d I said. \u201cI rather fancy that\u2019s the girl who used to act at the Frivolity\u2014only she called herself Zoe Carrisbrook. I remember she married some young man about town just before the War.\u201d", "\u201cWould it interest you, Hastings, to go down and hear what our visitor\u2019s particular little trouble is? Make him all my excuses.\u201d", "Roger Havering was a man of about forty, well set up and of smart appearance. His face, however, was haggard, and he was evidently labouring under great agitation.", "\u201cCaptain Hastings? You are Monsieur Poirot\u2019s partner, I understand. It is imperative that he should come with me to Derbyshire to-day.\u201d", "\u201cNo, in Derbyshire. I was in town and received a telegram from my wife this morning. Immediately upon its receipt I determined to come round and beg Monsieur Poirot to undertake the case.\u201d", "I rushed upstairs, and in a few brief words acquainted Poirot with the situation. He took any further words out of my mouth.", "\u201cI see. I see. You want to go yourself, is it not so? Well, why not? You should know my methods by now. All I ask is that you should report to me fully every day, and follow implicitly any instructions I may wire you.\u201d", "An hour later I was sitting opposite Mr. Havering in a first-class carriage on the Midland Railway, speeding rapidly away from London.", "\u201cTo begin with, Captain Hastings, you must understand that Hunter\u2019s Lodge, where we are going, and where the tragedy took place, is only a small shooting-box in the heart of the Derbyshire moors. Our real home is near Newmarket, and we usually rent a flat in town for the season. Hunter\u2019s Lodge is looked after by a housekeeper who is quite capable of doing all we need when we run down for an occasional week-end. Of course, during the shooting season, we take down some of our own servants from Newmarket. My uncle, Mr. Harrington Pace (as you may know, my mother was a Miss Pace of New York), has, for the last three years, made his home with us. He never got on well with my father, or my elder brother, and I suspect that my being somewhat of a prodigal son myself rather increased than diminished his affection towards me. Of course I am a poor man, and my uncle was a rich one\u2014in other words, he paid the piper! But, though exacting in many ways, he was not really hard to get on with, and we all three lived very harmoniously together. Two days ago my uncle, rather wearied with some recent gaieties of ours in town, suggested that we should run down to Derbyshire for a day or two. My wife telegraphed to Mrs. Middleton, the housekeeper, and we went down that same afternoon. Yesterday evening I was forced to return to town, but my wife and my uncle remained on. This morning I received this telegram.\u201d He handed it over to me:", "It was about three o\u2019clock when we arrived at the little station of Elmer\u2019s Dale. From there a five-mile drive brought us to a small grey stone building in the midst of the rugged moors.", "We unlatched the gate and were walking up the narrow path to the oak door when a familiar figure emerged and came to meet us.", "\u201cMr. Havering, I think? I\u2019ve been sent down from London to take charge of this case, and I\u2019d like a word with you, if I may, sir.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019ve seen your good lady, sir\u2014and the housekeeper. I won\u2019t keep you a moment, but I\u2019m anxious to get back to the village now that I\u2019ve seen all there is to see here.\u201d", "\u201cEx-actly,\u201d said Japp soothingly. \u201cBut there are just one or two little points I\u2019d like your opinion about all the same. Captain Hastings here, he knows me, and he\u2019ll go on up to the house and tell them you\u2019re coming. What have you done with the little man, by the way, Captain Hastings?\u201d", "\u201cIs he now? I\u2019m sorry to hear that. Rather the case of the cart without the horse, your being here without him, isn\u2019t it?\u201d", "And on his rather ill-timed jest I went on to the house. I rang the bell, as Japp had closed the door behind him. After some moments it was opened to me by a middle-aged woman in black.", "\u201cMr. Havering will be here in a moment,\u201d I explained. \u201cHe has been detained by the inspector. I have come down with him from London to look into the case. Perhaps you can tell me briefly what occurred last night.\u201d", "\u201cCome inside, sir.\u201d She closed the door behind me, and we stood in the dimly-lighted hall. \u201cIt was after dinner last night, sir, that the man came. He asked to see Mr. Pace, sir, and, seeing that he spoke the same way, I thought it was an American gentleman friend of Mr. Pace\u2019s and I showed him into the gun-room, and then went to tell Mr. Pace. He wouldn\u2019t give any name, which, of course, was a bit odd, now I come to think of it. I told Mr. Pace, and he seemed puzzled like, but he said to the mistress: \u2018Excuse me, Zoe, while I just see what this fellow wants.\u2019 He went off to the gun-room, and I went back to the kitchen, but after a while I heard loud voices, as if they were quarrelling, and I came out into the hall. At the same time, the mistress she comes out too, and just then there was a shot and then a dreadful silence. We both ran to the gun-room door, but it was locked and we had to go round to the window. It was open, and there inside was Mr. Pace, all shot and bleeding.\u201d", "\u201cMrs. Havering sent me to fetch the police. Five miles to walk it was. They came back with me, and the constable he stayed all night, and this morning the police gentleman from London arrived.\u201d", "\u201cHe had a black beard, sir, and was about middle-aged, and had on a light overcoat. Beyond the fact that he spoke like an American I didn\u2019t notice much about him.\u201d", "\u201cIf you please. Tell her that Mr. Havering is outside with Inspector Japp, and that the gentleman he has brought back with him from London is anxious to speak to her as soon as possible.\u201d", "I was in a fever of impatience to get at all the facts. Japp had two or three hours\u2019 start of me, and his anxiety to be gone made me keen to be close at his heels.", "Mrs. Havering did not keep me waiting long. In a few minutes I heard a light step descending the stairs, and looked up to see a very handsome young woman coming towards me. She wore a flame-coloured jumper, that set off the slender boyishness of her figure. On her dark head was a little hat of flame-coloured leather. Even the present tragedy could not dim the vitality of her personality.", "\u201cOf course I have often heard of you and your colleague, Monsieur Poirot. You have done some wonderful things together, haven\u2019t you? It was very clever of my husband to get you so promptly. Now will you ask me questions? That is the easiest way, isn\u2019t it, of getting to know all you want to about this dreadful affair?\u201d", "\u201cIt must have been just before nine o\u2019clock. We had finished dinner, and were sitting over our coffee and cigarettes.\u201d", "\u201cOur own car isn\u2019t down here. One came out from the garage in Elmer\u2019s Dale to fetch him in time for the train.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m afraid not. I didn\u2019t see him. Mrs. Middleton showed him straight into the gun-room and then came to tell my uncle.\u201d", "\u201cHe seemed rather annoyed, but went off at once. It was about five minutes later that I heard the sound of raised voices. I ran out into the hall and almost collided with Mrs. Middleton. Then we heard the shot. The gun-room door was locked on the inside, and we had to go right round the house to the window. Of course that took some time, and the murderer had been able to get well away. My poor uncle\u201d\u2014her voice faltered\u2014\u201chad been shot through the head. I saw at once that he was dead. I sent Mrs. Middleton for the police. I was careful to touch nothing in the room but to leave it exactly as I found it.\u201d", "\u201cWell, I can make a guess at it, Captain Hastings. A pair of revolvers of my husband\u2019s were mounted upon the wall. One of them is missing. I pointed this out to the police, and they took the other one away with them. When they have extracted the bullet, I suppose they will know for certain.\u201d", "She accompanied me to the scene of the crime. At that moment Havering entered the hall, and with a quick apology his wife ran to him. I was left to undertake my investigations alone.", "I may as well confess at once that they were rather disappointing. In detective novels clues abound, but here I could find nothing that struck me as out of the ordinary except a large bloodstain on the carpet where I judged the dead man had fallen. I examined everything with painstaking care and took a couple of pictures of the room with my little camera which I had brought with me. I also examined the ground outside the window, but it appeared to have been so heavily trampled underfoot that I judged it was useless to waste time over it. No, I had seen all that Hunter\u2019s Lodge had to show me. I must go back to Elmer\u2019s Dale and get into touch with Japp. Accordingly I took leave of the Haverings, and was driven off in the car that had brought us up from the station.", "I found Japp at the Matlock Arms and he took me forthwith to see the body. Harrington Pace was a small, spare clean-shaven man, typically American in appearance. He had been shot through the back of the head, and the revolver had been discharged at close quarters.", "\u201cTurned away for a moment,\u201d remarked Japp, \u201cand the other fellow snatched up a revolver and shot him. The one Mrs. Havering handed over to us was fully loaded and I suppose the other one was also. Curious what darn fool things people do. Fancy keeping two loaded revolvers hanging up on your wall.\u201d", "\u201cWell, I\u2019d got my eye on Havering to begin with. Oh, yes!\u201d noting my exclamation of astonishment. \u201cHavering has one or two shady incidents in his past. When he was a boy at Oxford there was some funny business about the signature on one of his father\u2019s cheques. All hushed up of course. Then, he\u2019s pretty heavily in debt now, and they\u2019re the kind of debts he wouldn\u2019t like to go to his uncle about, whereas you may be sure the uncle\u2019s will would be in his favour. Yes, I\u2019d got my eye on him, and that\u2019s why I wanted to speak to him before he saw his wife, but their statements dovetail all right, and I\u2019ve been to the station and there\u2019s no doubt whatever that he left by the 6.15. That gets up to London about 10.30. He went straight to his club, he says, and if that\u2019s confirmed all right\u2014why, he couldn\u2019t have been shooting his uncle here at nine o\u2019clock in a black beard!\u201d", "\u201cI think it grew pretty fast\u2014grew in the five miles from Elmer\u2019s Dale to Hunter\u2019s Lodge. Americans that I\u2019ve met are mostly clean-shaven. Yes, it\u2019s amongst Mr. Pace\u2019s American associates that we\u2019ll have to look for the murderer. I questioned the housekeeper first, and then her mistress, and their stories agree all right, but I\u2019m sorry Mrs. Havering didn\u2019t get a look at the fellow. She\u2019s a smart woman, and she might have noticed something that would set us on the track.\u201d", "I sat down and wrote a minute and lengthy account to Poirot. I was able to add various further items of information before I posted the letter.", "The bullet had been extracted and was proved to have been fired from a revolver identical with the one held by the police. Furthermore, Mr. Havering\u2019s movements on the night in question had been checked and verified, and it was proved beyond doubt that he had actually arrived in London by the train in question. And, thirdly, a sensational development had occurred. A city gentleman, living at Ealing, on crossing Haven Green to get to the District Railway Station that morning, had observed a brown-paper parcel stuck between the railings. Opening it, he found that it contained a revolver. He handed the parcel over to the local police station, and before night it was proved to be the one we were in search of, the fellow to that given us by Mrs. Havering. One bullet had been fired from it.", "All this I added to my report. A wire from Poirot arrived whilst I was at breakfast the following morning:", "\u201cOf course black bearded man was not Havering only you or Japp would have such an idea wire me description of housekeeper and what clothes she wore this morning same of Mrs. Havering do not waste time taking photographs of interiors they are underexposed and not in the least artistic.\u201d", "It seemed to me that Poirot\u2019s style was unnecessarily facetious. I also fancied he was a shade jealous of my position on the spot with full facilities for handling the case. His request for a description of the clothes worn by the two women appeared to me to be simply ridiculous, but I complied as well as I, a mere man, was able to.", "\u201cHe\u2019s the goods, Monsieur Poirot! If he says so, there\u2019s something in it. And I hardly noticed the woman. I don\u2019t know that I can go so far as arresting her, but I\u2019ll have her watched. We\u2019ll go up right away, and take another look at her.\u201d", "But it was too late. Mrs. Middleton, that quiet middle-aged woman, who had appeared so normal and respectable, had vanished into thin air. Her box had been left behind. It contained only ordinary wearing apparel. There was no clue in it to her identity, or as to her whereabouts.", "\u201cI engaged her about three weeks ago when Mrs. Emery, our former housekeeper, left. She came to me from Mrs. Selbourne\u2019s Agency in Mount Street\u2014a very well-known place. I get all my servants from there. They sent several women to see me, but this Mrs. Middleton seemed much the nicest, and had splendid references. I engaged her on the spot, and notified the Agency of the fact. I can\u2019t believe that there was anything wrong with her. She was such a nice quiet woman.\u201d", "The thing was certainly a mystery. Whilst it was clear that the woman herself could not have committed the crime, since at the moment the shot was fired Mrs. Havering was with her in the hall, nevertheless she must have some connection with the murder, or why should she suddenly take to her heels and bolt?", "\u201cUseless to inquire at agency they will never have heard of her find out what vehicle took her up to hunters lodge when she first arrived there.\u201d", "Though mystified, I was obedient. The means of transport in Elmer\u2019s Dale were limited. The local garage had two battered Ford cars, and there were two station flies. None of these had been requisitioned on the date in question. Questioned, Mrs. Havering explained that she had given the woman the money for her fare down to Derbyshire and sufficient to hire a car or fly to take her up to Hunter\u2019s Lodge. There was usually one of the Fords at the station on the chance of its being required. Taking into consideration the further fact that nobody at the station had noticed the arrival of a stranger, black-bearded or otherwise, on the fatal evening, everything seemed to point to the conclusion that the murderer had come to the spot in a car, which had been waiting near at hand to aid his escape, and that the same car had brought the mysterious housekeeper to her new post. I may mention that inquiries at the Agency in London bore out Poirot\u2019s prognostication. No such woman as \u201cMrs. Middleton\u201d had ever been on their books. They had received the Hon. Mrs. Havering\u2019s application for a housekeeper, and had sent her various applicants for the post. When she sent them the engagement fee, she omitted to mention which woman she had selected.", "Somewhat crestfallen, I returned to London. I found Poirot established in an arm-chair by the fire in a garish, silk dressing-gown. He greeted me with much affection.", "\u201c_Mon ami_ Hastings! But how glad I am to see you. Veritably I have for you a great affection. And you have enjoyed yourself? You have run to and fro with the good Japp? You have interrogated and investigated to your heart\u2019s content?\u201d", "\u201cOh, as far as that goes, I am very good at cracking the nuts! A veritable squirrel! It is not that which embarrasses me. I know well enough who killed Mr. Harrington Pace.\u201d", "\u201cYour illuminating answers to my wires supplied me with the truth. See here, Hastings, let us examine the facts methodically and in order. Mr. Harrington Pace is a man with a considerable fortune which at his death will doubtless pass to his nephew. Point No. 1. His nephew is known to be desperately hard up. Point No. 2. His nephew is also known to be\u2014shall we say a man of rather loose moral fibre? Point No. 3.\u201d", "\u201c_Pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment_\u2014and therefore, as Mr. Havering left Elmer\u2019s Dale at 6.15, and since Mr. Pace cannot have been killed before he left, or the doctor would have spotted the time of the crime as being given wrongly when he examined the body, we conclude quite rightly, that Mr. Havering did not shoot his uncle. But there is a Mrs. Havering, Hastings.\u201d", "\u201cI think not. There is something peculiarly elusive about that housekeeper, don\u2019t you think so, Hastings? It struck me at once.\u201d", "\u201cOh, no, that was not her part! Her part was what you have just mentioned, to provide an alibi for Mrs. Havering at the moment the shot was fired. And no one will ever find her, _mon ami_, because she does not exist! \u2018There\u2019s no sech person,\u2019 as your so great Shakespeare says.\u201d", "\u201cI mean that Zoe Havering was an actress before her marriage, that you and Japp only saw the housekeeper in a dark hall, a dim middle-aged figure in black with a faint subdued voice, and finally that neither you nor Japp, nor the local police whom the housekeeper fetched, ever saw Mrs. Middleton and her mistress at one and the same time. It was child\u2019s play for that clever and daring woman. On the pretext of summoning her mistress, she runs upstairs, slips on a bright jumper and a hat with black curls attached which she jams down over the grey transformation. A few deft touches, and the make-up is removed, a slight dusting of rouge, and the brilliant Zoe Havering comes down with her clear ringing voice. Nobody looks particularly at the housekeeper. Why should they? There is nothing to connect her with the crime. She, too, has an alibi.\u201d", "\u201cNo, that was Roger Havering\u2019s job\u2014but it was a mistake on their part. It put me on the right track. A man who has committed a murder with a revolver which he found on the spot would fling it away at once, he would not carry it up to London with him. No, the motive was clear, the criminals wished to focus the interest of the police on a spot far removed from Derbyshire they were anxious to get the police away as soon as possible from the vicinity of Hunter\u2019s Lodge. Of course the revolver found at Ealing was not the one with which Mr. Pace was shot. Roger Havering discharged one shot from it, brought it up to London, went straight to his club to establish his alibi, then went quickly out to Ealing by the district, a matter of about twenty minutes only, placed the parcel where it was found and so back to town. That charming creature, his wife, quietly shoots Mr. Pace after dinner\u2014you remember he was shot from behind? Another significant point, that!\u2014reloads the revolver and puts it back in its place, and then starts off with her desperate little comedy.\u201d", "\u201cAnd yet it is true. _Bien sur_, my friend, it is true. But to bring that precious pair to justice, that is another matter. Well, Japp must do what he can\u2014I have written him fully\u2014but I very much fear, Hastings, that we shall be obliged to leave them to Fate, or _le bon Dieu_, whichever you prefer.\u201d", "Poirot\u2019s forebodings were confirmed. Japp, though convinced of the truth of his theory, was unable to get together the necessary evidence to ensure a conviction.", "Mr. Pace\u2019s huge fortune passed into the hands of his murderers. Nevertheless, Nemesis did overtake them, and when I read in the paper that the Hon. Roger and Mrs. Havering were amongst those killed in the crashing of the Air Mail to Paris I knew that Justice was satisfied.", "\u201cWhat a number of bond robberies there have been lately!\u201d I observed one morning, laying aside the newspaper. \u201cPoirot, let us forsake the science of detection, and take to crime instead!\u201d", "\u201cWell, look at this last _coup_, the million dollars\u2019 worth of Liberty Bonds which the London and Scottish Bank were sending to New York, and which disappeared in such a remarkable manner on board the _Olympia_.\u201d", "\u201cIf it were not for the _mal de mer_, and the difficulty of practising the so excellent method of Laverguier for a longer time than the few hours of crossing the channel, I should delight to voyage myself on one of these big liners,\u201d murmured Poirot dreamily.", "\u201cYes, indeed,\u201d I said enthusiastically. \u201cSome of them must be perfect palaces; the swimming-baths, the lounges, the restaurant, the palm courts\u2014really, it must be hard to believe that one is on the sea.\u201d", "\u201cMe, I always know when I am on the sea,\u201d said Poirot sadly. \u201cAnd all those bagatelles that you enumerate, they say nothing to me; but, my friend, consider for a moment the geniuses that travel as it were incognito! On board these floating palaces, as you so justly call them, one would meet the \u00e9lite, the _haute noblesse_ of the criminal world!\u201d", "\u201cSo that\u2019s the way your enthusiasm runs! You would have liked to cross swords with the man who sneaked the Liberty Bonds?\u201d", "The card bore the inscription: Miss Esm\u00e9e Farquhar, and Poirot, after diving under the table to retrieve a stray crumb, and putting it carefully in the waste-paper-basket, nodded to the landlady to admit her.", "In another minute one of the most charming girls I have ever seen was ushered into the room. She was perhaps about five-and-twenty, with big brown eyes and a perfect figure. She was well-dressed and perfectly composed in manner.", "\u201cSit down, I beg of you, mademoiselle. This is my friend, Captain Hastings, who aids me in my little problems.\u201d", "\u201cI am afraid it is a big problem I have brought you to-day, Monsieur Poirot,\u201d said the girl, giving me a pleasant bow as she seated herself. \u201cI dare say you have read about it in the papers. I am referring to the theft of Liberty Bonds on the _Olympia_.\u201d Some astonishment must have shown itself in Poirot\u2019s face, for she continued quickly: \u201cYou are doubtless asking yourself what I have to do with a grave institution like the London and Scottish Bank. In one sense nothing, in another sense everything. You see, Monsieur Poirot, I am engaged to Mr. Philip Ridgeway.\u201d", "\u201cWas in charge of the bonds when they were stolen. Of course no actual blame can attach to him, it was not his fault in any way. Nevertheless, he is half distraught over the matter, and his uncle, I know, insists that he must carelessly have mentioned having them in his possession. It is a terrible set-back in his career.\u201d", "\u201cVery well. As you know, the Bank wished to extend their credits in America, and for this purpose decided to send over a million dollars in Liberty Bonds. Mr. Vavasour selected his nephew, who had occupied a position of trust in the Bank for many years and who was conversant with all the details of the Bank\u2019s dealings in New York, to make the trip. The Olympia sailed from Liverpool on the 23rd, and the bonds were handed over to Philip on the morning of that day by Mr. Vavasour and Mr. Shaw, the two joint general managers of the London and Scottish Bank. They were counted, enclosed in a package, and sealed in his presence, and he then locked the package at once in his portmanteau.\u201d", "\u201cNo, Mr. Shaw insisted on a special lock being fitted to it by Hubbs\u2019s. Philip, as I say, placed the package at the bottom of the trunk. It was stolen just a few hours before reaching New York. A rigorous search of the whole ship was made, but without result. The bonds seemed literally to have vanished into thin air.\u201d", "\u201cBut they did not vanish absolutely, since I gather that they were sold in small parcels within half an hour of the docking of the _Olympia_! Well, undoubtedly the next thing is for me to see Mr. Ridgeway.\u201d", "\u201cI was about to suggest that you should lunch with me at the \u2018Cheshire Cheese.\u2019 Philip will be there. He is meeting me, but does not yet know that I have been consulting you on his behalf.\u201d", "Mr. Philip Ridgeway was there before us, and looked somewhat surprised to see his fianc\u00e9e arriving with two complete strangers. He was a nice-looking young fellow, tall and spruce, with a touch of greying hair at the temples, though he could not have been much over thirty.", "\u201cYou must forgive my acting without consulting you, Philip,\u201d she said. \u201cLet me introduce you to Monsieur Hercule Poirot, of whom you must often have heard, and his friend, Captain Hastings.\u201d", "\u201cOf course I have heard of you, Monsieur Poirot,\u201d he said, as he shook hands. \u201cBut I had no idea that Esm\u00e9e was thinking of consulting you about my\u2014our trouble.\u201d", "\u201cSo you took care to be on the safe side,\u201d he observed, with a smile. \u201cI hope Monsieur Poirot will be able to throw some light on this extraordinary puzzle, for I confess frankly that I am nearly out of my mind with worry and anxiety about it.\u201d", "\u201cWell, well,\u201d said Poirot. \u201cLet us lunch, and over lunch we will put our heads together and see what can be done. I want to hear Mr. Ridgeway\u2019s story from his own lips.\u201d", "Whilst we discussed the excellent steak and kidney pudding of the establishment, Philip Ridgeway narrated the circumstances leading to the disappearance of the bonds. His story agreed with that of Miss Farquhar in every particular. When he had finished, Poirot took up the thread with a question.", "\u201cThe thing stared me in the face, Monsieur Poirot. I couldn\u2019t have missed it. My cabin trunk was half out from under the bunk and all scratched and cut about where they\u2019d tried to force the lock.\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s so. They tried to force it, but couldn\u2019t. And, in the end, they must have got it unlocked somehow or other.\u201d", "\u201cCurious,\u201d said Poirot, his eyes beginning to flicker with the green light I knew so well. \u201cVery curious! They waste much, much time trying to prise it open, and then\u2014_sapristi!_ they find that they have the key all the time\u2014for each of Hubbs\u2019s locks are unique.\u201d", "\u201cI can swear to it, and besides, if they had had the key or a duplicate, why should they waste time trying to force an obviously unforceable lock?\u201d", "\u201cAh! there is exactly the question we are asking ourselves! I venture to prophesy that the solution, if we ever find it, will hinge on that curious fact. I beg of you not to assault me if I ask you one more question: _Are you perfectly certain you did not leave the trunk unlocked?_\u201d", "\u201cAh, but these things can happen, I assure you! Very well, the bonds were stolen from the trunk. What did the thief do with them? How did he manage to get ashore with them?\u201d", "\u201cAh!\u201d cried Ridgeway. \u201cThat\u2019s just it. How? Word was passed to the Customs authorities, and every soul that left the ship was gone over with a toothcomb!\u201d", "\u201cCertainly they did. They could hardly have been hidden on board\u2014and anyway we know they weren\u2019t because they were offered for sale within half an hour of the _Olympia\u2019s_ arrival, long before I got the cables going and the numbers sent out. One broker swears he bought some of them even before the _Olympia_ got in. But you can\u2019t send bonds by wireless.\u201d", "\u201cOnly the official ones, and that was after the alarm was given when every one was on the look-out. I was watching out myself for their being passed over to some one that way. My God, Monsieur Poirot, this thing will drive me mad! People are beginning to say I stole them myself.\u201d", "\u201cYou do not catch my meaning, I see,\u201d said Poirot, smiling enigmatically. \u201cNow I should like to make a few inquiries at the Bank.\u201d", "Poirot thanked him, bade farewell to Miss Farquhar, and together we started out for Threadneedle Street and the head office of the London and Scottish Bank. On production of Ridgeway\u2019s card, we were led through the labyrinth of counters and desks, skirting paying-in clerks and paying-out clerks and up to a small office on the first floor where the joint general managers received us. They were two grave gentlemen, who had grown grey in the service of the Bank. Mr. Vavasour had a short white beard, Mr. Shaw was clean shaven.", "\u201cI understand you are strictly a private inquiry agent?\u201d said Mr. Vavasour. \u201cQuite so, quite so. We have, of course, placed ourselves in the hands of Scotland Yard. Inspector McNeil has charge of the case. A very able officer, I believe.\u201d", "\u201cI am sure of it,\u201d said Poirot politely. \u201cYou will permit a few questions, on your nephew\u2019s behalf? About this lock, who ordered it from Hubbs\u2019s?\u201d", "\u201cI ordered it myself,\u201d said Mr. Shaw. \u201cI would not trust to any clerk in the matter. As to the keys, Mr. Ridgeway had one, and the other two are held by my colleague and myself.\u201d", "Mr. Shaw turned inquiringly to Mr. Vavasour. \u201cI think I am correct in saying that they have remained in the safe where we placed them on the 23rd,\u201d said Mr. Vavasour. \u201cMy colleague was unfortunately taken ill a fortnight ago\u2014in fact on the very day that Philip left us. He has only just recovered.\u201d", "\u201cSevere bronchitis is no joke to a man of my age,\u201d said Mr. Shaw ruefully. \u201cBut I am afraid Mr. Vavasour has suffered from the hard work entailed by my absence, especially with this unexpected worry coming on top of everything.\u201d", "Poirot asked a few more questions. I judged that he was endeavouring to gauge the exact amount of intimacy between uncle and nephew. Mr. Vavasour\u2019s answers were brief and punctilious. His nephew was a trusted official of the Bank, and had no debts or money difficulties that he knew of. He had been entrusted with similar missions in the past. Finally we were politely bowed out.", "\u201cIt is not their stodginess which disappoints me, _mon ami_. I do not expect to find in a Bank manager a \u2018keen financier with an eagle glance\u2019 as your favourite works of fiction put it. No, I am disappointed in the case\u2014it is too easy!\u201d", "\u201cTo a South Sea island where there is no extradition? No, _mon ami_, he would find life very uncongenial there. As to why I wait\u2014_eh bien_ to the intelligence of Hercule Poirot the case is perfectly clear, but for the benefit of others, not so greatly gifted by the good God\u2014the Inspector McNeil, for instance\u2014it would be as well to make a few inquiries to establish the facts. One must have consideration for those less gifted than oneself.\u201d", "\u201cGood Lord, Poirot! Do you know, I\u2019d give a considerable sum of money to see you make a thorough ass of yourself\u2014just for once. You\u2019re so confoundedly conceited!\u201d", "\u201cDo not enrage yourself, Hastings. In verity, I observe that there are times when you almost detest me! Alas, I suffer the penalties of greatness!\u201d", "Tuesday saw us speeding to Liverpool in a first-class carriage of the L. & N.W.R. Poirot had obstinately refused to enlighten me as to his suspicions\u2014or certainties. He contented himself with expressing surprise that I, too, was not equally _au fait_ with the situation. I disdained to argue, and entrenched my curiosity behind a rampart of pretended indifference.", "Once arrived at the quay alongside which lay the big transatlantic liner, Poirot became brisk and alert. Our proceedings consisted in interviewing four successive stewards and inquiring after a friend of Poirot\u2019s who had crossed to New York on the 23rd.", "The description appeared to tally with one Mr. Ventnor who had occupied the cabin C 24 which was next to that of Philip Ridgeway. Although unable to see how Poirot had deduced Mr. Ventnor\u2019s existence and personal appearance, I was keenly excited.", "\u201cTell me,\u201d I cried, \u201cwas this gentleman one of the first to land when you got to New York?\u201d The steward shook his head.", "I retired crestfallen, and observed Poirot grinning at me. He thanked the steward, a note changed hands, and we took our departure.", "\u201cIt\u2019s all very well,\u201d I remarked heatedly, \u201cbut that last answer must have damped your precious theory, grin as you please!\u201d", "When we were in the train, speeding towards London, Poirot wrote busily for a few minutes, sealing up the result in an envelope.", "\u201cThis is for the good Inspector McNeil. We will leave it at Scotland Yard in passing, and then to the Rendezvous Restaurant, where I have asked Miss Esm\u00e9e Farquhar to do us the honour of dining with us.\u201d", "\u201cThe habit of incoherence is growing upon you, Hastings. As a matter of fact I _did_ think. If Ridgeway had been the thief\u2014which was perfectly possible\u2014the case would have been charming; a piece of neat methodical work.\u201d", "\u201cPossibly you are right. Therefore all is for the best. Now, Hastings, let us review the case. I can see that you are dying to do so. The sealed package is removed from the trunk and vanishes, as Miss Farquhar puts it, into thin air. We will dismiss the thin air theory, which is not practicable at the present stage of science, and consider what is likely to have become of it. Every one asserts the incredibility of its being smuggled ashore\u2014\u2014\u201d", "\u201c_You_ may know, Hastings. I do not. I take the view that, since it seemed incredible, it _was_ incredible. Two possibilities remain: it was hidden on board\u2014also rather difficult\u2014or it was thrown overboard.\u201d", "\u201cI admire your logical mind, Hastings. The bonds were sold in New York, therefore they were not thrown overboard. You see where that leads us?\u201d", "\u201c_Jamais de la vie!_ If the package was thrown overboard, and the bonds were sold in New York, the package could not have contained the bonds. Is there any evidence that the package _did_ contain the bonds? Remember, Mr. Ridgeway never opened it from the time it was placed in his hands in London.\u201d", "\u201cPermit me to continue. The last moment that the bonds are seen as bonds is in the office of the London and Scottish Bank on the morning of the 23rd. They reappear in New York half an hour after the _Olympia_ gets in, and according to one man, whom nobody listens to, actually _before_ she gets in. Supposing then, that they have never been on the _Olympia_ at all? Is there any other way they could get to New York? Yes. The _Gigantic_ leaves Southampton on the same day as the _Olympia_, and she holds the record for the Atlantic. Mailed by the _Gigantic_, the bonds would be in New York the day before the _Olympia_ arrived. All is clear, the case begins to explain itself. The sealed packet is only a dummy, and the moment of its substitution must be in the office in the Bank. It would be an easy matter for any of the three men present to have prepared a duplicate package which could be substituted for the genuine one. _Tr\u00e8s bien_, the bonds are mailed to a confederate in New York, with instructions to sell as soon as the _Olympia_ is in, but some one must travel on the _Olympia_ to engineer the supposed moment of the robbery.\u201d", "\u201cBecause if Ridgeway merely opens the packet and finds it a dummy, suspicion flies at once to London. No, the man on board in the cabin next door does his work, pretends to force the lock in an obvious manner so as to draw immediate attention to the theft, really unlocks the trunk with a duplicate key, throws the package overboard and waits until the last to leave the boat. Naturally he wears glasses to conceal his eyes, and is an invalid since he does not want to run the risk of meeting Ridgeway. He steps ashore in New York and returns by the first boat available.\u201d", "\u201cThe man who had a duplicate key, the man who ordered the lock, the man who has _not_ been severely ill with bronchitis at his home in the country\u2014_enfin_, that \u2018stodgy\u2019 old man, Mr. Shaw! There are criminals in high places sometimes, my friend. Ah, here we are. Mademoiselle, I have succeeded! You permit?\u201d", "I have always considered that one of the most thrilling and dramatic of the many adventures I have shared with Poirot was that of our investigation into the strange series of deaths which followed upon the discovery and opening of the Tomb of King Men-her-Ra.", "Hard upon the discovery of the Tomb of Tut-ankh-Amen by Lord Carnarvon, Sir John Willard and Mr. Bleibner of New York, pursuing their excavations not far from Cairo, in the vicinity of the Pyramids of Gizeh, came unexpectedly on a series of funeral chambers. The greatest interest was aroused by their discovery. The Tomb appeared to be that of King Men-her-Ra, one of those shadowy kings of the Eighth Dynasty, when the Old Kingdom was falling to decay. Little was known about this period, and the discoveries were fully reported in the newspapers.", "An event soon occurred which took a profound hold on the public mind. Sir John Willard died quite suddenly of heart failure.", "The more sensational newspapers immediately took the opportunity of reviving all the old superstitious stories connected with the ill luck of certain Egyptian treasures. The unlucky Mummy at the British Museum, that hoary old chestnut, was dragged out with fresh zest, was quietly denied by the Museum, but nevertheless enjoyed all its usual vogue.", "A fortnight later Mr. Bleibner died of acute blood poisoning, and a few days afterwards a nephew of his shot himself in New York. The \u201cCurse of Men-her-Ra\u201d was the talk of the day, and the magic power of dead and gone Egypt was exalted to a fetish point.", "It was then that Poirot received a brief note from Lady Willard, widow of the dead archaeologist, asking him to go and see her at her house in Kensington Square. I accompanied him.", "Lady Willard was a tall, thin woman, dressed in deep mourning. Her haggard face bore eloquent testimony to her recent grief.", "\u201cYou are, I am aware, a detective, but it is not only as a detective that I wish to consult you. You are a man of original views, I know, you have imagination, experience of the world, tell me, Monsieur Poirot, what are your views on the supernatural?\u201d", "\u201cLet us not misunderstand each other, Lady Willard. It is not a general question that you are asking me there. It has a personal application, has it not? You are referring obliquely to the death of your late husband?\u201d", "\u201cI want you to ascertain for me exactly how much is newspaper chatter, and how much may be said to be founded on fact? Three deaths, Monsieur Poirot\u2014each one explicable taken by itself, but taken together surely an almost unbelievable coincidence, and all within a month of the opening of the tomb! It may be mere superstition, it may be some potent curse from the past that operates in ways undreamed of by modern science. The fact remains\u2014three deaths! And I am afraid, Monsieur Poirot, horribly afraid. It may not yet be the end.\u201d", "\u201cFor my son. When the news of my husband\u2019s death came I was ill. My son, who has just come down from Oxford, went out there. He brought the\u2014the body home, but now he has gone out again, in spite of my prayers and entreaties. He is so fascinated by the work that he intends to take his father\u2019s place and carry on the system of excavations. You may think me a foolish, credulous woman, but, Monsieur Poirot, I am afraid. Supposing that the spirit of the dead King is not yet appeased? Perhaps to you I seem to be talking nonsense\u2014\u2014\u201d", "\u201cNo, indeed, Lady Willard,\u201d said Poirot quickly. \u201cI, too, believe in the force of superstition, one of the greatest forces the world has ever known.\u201d", "I looked at him in surprise. I should never have credited Poirot with being superstitious. But the little man was obviously in earnest.", "\u201cWhat you really demand is that I shall protect your son? I will do my utmost to keep him from harm.\u201d", "\u201cIn volumes of the Middle Ages, Lady Willard, you will find many ways of counteracting black magic. Perhaps they knew more than we moderns with all our boasted science. Now let us come to facts, that I may have guidance. Your husband had always been a devoted Egyptologist, hadn\u2019t he?\u201d", "\u201cOh, quite. He was a very wealthy man who dabbled freely in any subject that happened to take his fancy. My husband managed to interest him in Egyptology, and it was his money that was so useful in financing the expedition.\u201d", "\u201cI do not think so. In fact I never knew of his existence till I read of his death in the paper, I do not think he and Mr. Bleibner can have been at all intimate. He never spoke of having any relations.\u201d", "\u201cWell, there is Dr. Tosswill, a minor official connected with the British Museum; Mr. Schneider of the Metropolitan Museum in New York; a young American secretary; Dr. Ames, who accompanies the expedition in his professional capacity; and Hassan, my husband\u2019s devoted native servant.\u201d", "\u201cHarper, I think, but I cannot be sure. He had not been with Mr. Bleibner very long, I know. He was a very pleasant young fellow.\u201d", "\u201cFor the moment, nothing. Leave it now in my hands, and be assured that I will do all that is humanly possible to protect your son.\u201d", "They were not exactly reassuring words, and I observed Lady Willard wince as he uttered them. Yet, at the same time, the fact that he had not pooh-poohed her fears seemed in itself to be a relief to her.", "For my part I had never before suspected that Poirot had so deep a vein of superstition in his nature. I tackled him on the subject as we went homewards. His manner was grave and earnest.", "\u201c_Toujours pratique_, the good Hastings! _Eh bien_, to begin with we are going to cable to New York for fuller details of young Mr. Bleibner\u2019s death.\u201d", "He duly sent off his cable. The reply was full and precise. Young Rupert Bleibner had been in low water for several years. He had been a beach-comber and a remittance man in several South Sea islands, but had returned to New York two years ago, where he had rapidly sunk lower and lower. The most significant thing, to my mind, was that he had recently managed to borrow enough money to take him to Egypt. \u201cI\u2019ve a good friend there I can borrow from,\u201d he had declared. Here, however, his plans had gone awry. He had returned to New York cursing his skinflint of an uncle who cared more for the bones of dead and gone kings than his own flesh and blood. It was during his sojourn in Egypt that the death of Sir John Willard occurred. Rupert had plunged once more into his life of dissipation in New York, and then, without warning, he had committed suicide, leaving behind him a letter which contained some curious phrases. It seemed written in a sudden fit of remorse. He referred to himself as a leper and an outcast, and the letter ended by declaring that such as he were better dead.", "A shadowy theory leapt into my brain. I had never really believed in the vengeance of a long dead Egyptian king. I saw here a more modern crime. Supposing this young man had decided to do away with his uncle\u2014preferably by poison. By mistake, Sir John Willard receives the fatal dose. The young man returns to New York, haunted by his crime. The news of his uncle\u2019s death reaches him. He realizes how unnecessary his crime has been, and stricken with remorse takes his own life.", "\u201cIt is ingenious what you have thought of there\u2014decidedly it is ingenious. It may even be true. But you leave out of count the fatal influence of the Tomb.\u201d", "\u201cI have said it.\u201d An expression of conscious heroism spread over Poirot\u2019s face. Then he groaned. \u201cBut, oh,\u201d he lamented, \u201cthe sea! The hateful sea!\u201d", "It was a week later. Beneath our feet was the golden sand of the desert. The hot sun poured down overhead. Poirot, the picture of misery, wilted by my side. The little man was not a good traveller. Our four days\u2019 voyage from Marseilles had been one long agony to him. He had landed at Alexandria the wraith of his former self, even his usual neatness had deserted him. We had arrived in Cairo and had driven out at once to the Mena House Hotel, right in the shadow of the Pyramids.", "The charm of Egypt had laid hold of me. Not so Poirot. Dressed precisely the same as in London, he carried a small clothes-brush in his pocket and waged an unceasing war on the dust which accumulated on his dark apparel.", "\u201cAnd my boots,\u201d he wailed. \u201cRegard them, Hastings. My boots, of the neat patent leather, usually so smart and shining. See, the sand is inside them, which is painful, and outside them, which outrages the eyesight. Also the heat, it causes my moustaches to become limp\u2014but limp!\u201d", "\u201cIt has not the air happy,\u201d he declared. \u201cHow could it, half-buried in sand in that untidy fashion. Ah, this cursed sand!\u201d", "\u201cCome, now, there\u2019s a lot of sand in Belgium,\u201d I reminded him, mindful of a holiday spent at Knocke-sur-mer in the midst of \u201c_les dunes impeccables_\u201d as the guide-book had phrased it.", "\u201cNot in Brussels,\u201d declared Poirot. He gazed at the Pyramids thoughtfully. \u201cIt is true that they, at least, are of a shape solid and geometrical, but their surface is of an unevenness most unpleasing. And the palm-trees I like them not. Not even do they plant them in rows!\u201d", "I cut short his lamentations, by suggesting that we should start for the camp. We were to ride there on camels, and the beasts were patiently kneeling, waiting for us to mount, in charge of several picturesque boys headed by a voluble dragoman.", "I pass over the spectacle of Poirot on a camel. He started by groans and lamentations and ended by shrieks, gesticulations and invocations to the Virgin Mary and every Saint in the calendar. In the end, he descended ignominiously and finished the journey on a diminutive donkey. I must admit that a trotting camel is no joke for the amateur. I was stiff for several days.", "At last we neared the scene of the excavations. A sunburnt man with a grey beard, in white clothes and wearing a helmet, came to meet us.", "\u201cMonsieur Poirot and Captain Hastings? We received your cable. I\u2019m sorry that there was no one to meet you in Cairo. An unforeseen event occurred which completely disorganized our plans.\u201d", "I blanched. All around me I seemed to feel an atmosphere of evil, subtle and menacing. A horrible thought flashed across me. Supposing I were the next?", "\u201c_Mon Dieu_,\u201d said Poirot, in a very low voice, \u201cI do not understand this. It is horrible. Tell me, monsieur, there is no doubt that it was tetanus?\u201d", "This, then, was the British expert described by Lady Willard as being a minor official at the British Museum. There was something at once grave and steadfast about him that took my fancy.", "\u201cIf you will come with me,\u201d continued Dr. Tosswill, \u201cI will take you to Sir Guy Willard. He was most anxious to be informed as soon as you should arrive.\u201d", "We were taken across the camp to a large tent. Dr. Tosswill lifted up the flap and we entered. Three men were sitting inside.", "The youngest of the three men jumped up and came forward to greet us. There was a certain impulsiveness in his manner which reminded me of his mother. He was not nearly so sunburnt as the others, and that fact, coupled with a certain haggardness round the eyes, made him look older than his twenty-two years. He was clearly endeavouring to bear up under a severe mental strain.", "He introduced his two companions, Dr. Ames, a capable looking man of thirty odd, with a touch of greying hair at the temples, and Mr. Harper, the secretary, a pleasant lean young man wearing the national insignia of horn-rimmed spectacles.", "After a few minutes\u2019 desultory conversation the latter went out, and Dr. Tosswill followed him. We were left alone with Sir Guy and Dr. Ames.", "\u201cPlease ask any questions you want to ask, Monsieur Poirot,\u201d said Willard. \u201cWe are utterly dumbfounded at this strange series of disasters, but it isn\u2019t\u2014it can\u2019t be, anything but coincidence.\u201d", "There was a nervousness about his manner which rather belied the words. I saw that Poirot was studying him keenly.", "\u201cRather. No matter what happens, or what comes of it, the work is going on. Make up your mind to that.\u201d", "\u201cAbsolutely plumb certain. He had a scratch upon his thumb which became poisoned, and septic\u00e6mia set in. It sounds pretty much the same to a layman, I dare say, but the two things are entirely different.\u201d", "\u201cI will put it plainly. Was any act committed by those four men which might seem to denote disrespect to the spirit of Men-her-Ra?\u201d", "\u201cNo, sir, I do not,\u201d declared the doctor emphatically. \u201cI am a scientific man, and I believe only what science teaches.\u201d", "\u201cWas there no science then in Ancient Egypt?\u201d asked Poirot softly. He did not wait for a reply, and indeed Dr. Ames seemed rather at a loss for the moment. \u201cNo, no, do not answer me, but tell me this. What do the native workmen think?\u201d", "\u201cI guess,\u201d said Dr. Ames, \u201cthat, where white folk lose their heads, natives aren\u2019t going to be far behind. I\u2019ll admit that they\u2019re getting what you might call scared\u2014but they\u2019ve no cause to be.\u201d", "\u201cSurely,\u201d he cried incredulously, \u201cyou cannot believe in\u2014oh, but the thing\u2019s absurd! You can know nothing of Ancient Egypt if you think that.\u201d", "For answer Poirot produced a little book from his pocket\u2014an ancient tattered volume. As he held it out I saw its title, _The Magic of the Egyptians and Chaldeans_. Then, wheeling round, he strode out of the tent. The doctor stared at me.", "I went in search of Poirot, and found him talking to the lean-faced young man who had been the late Mr. Bleibner\u2019s secretary.", "\u201cNo,\u201d Mr. Harper was saying, \u201cI\u2019ve only been six months with the expedition. Yes, I knew Mr. Bleibner\u2019s affairs pretty well.\u201d", "\u201cHe turned up here one day, not a bad-looking fellow. I\u2019d never met him before, but some of the others had\u2014Ames, I think, and Schneider. The old man wasn\u2019t at all pleased to see him. They were at it in no time, hammer and tongs. \u2018Not a cent,\u2019 the old man shouted. \u2018Not one cent now or when I\u2019m dead. I intend to leave my money to the furtherance of my life\u2019s work. I\u2019ve been talking it over with Mr. Schneider to-day.\u2019 And a bit more of the same. Young Bleibner lit out for Cairo right away.\u201d", "\u201cI believe he did mention there was something wrong with him. But it couldn\u2019t have been anything serious, or I should have remembered.\u201d", "\u201cNo, sir, I am not. I\u2019m for New York as soon as I can square up things here. You may laugh if you like, but I\u2019m not going to be this blasted old Men-her-Ra\u2019s next victim. He\u2019ll get me if I stop here.\u201d", "I glanced at Poirot curiously, but his enigmatical smile told me nothing. In company with Sir Guy Willard and Dr. Tosswill we were taken round the excavations. The principal finds had been removed to Cairo, but some of the tomb furniture was extremely interesting. The enthusiasm of the young baronet was obvious, but I fancied that I detected a shade of nervousness in his manner as though he could not quite escape from the feeling of menace in the air. As we entered the tent which had been assigned to us, for a wash before joining the evening meal, a tall dark figure in white robes stood aside to let us pass with a graceful gesture and a murmured greeting in Arabic. Poirot stopped.", "\u201cI served my Lord Sir John, now I serve his son.\u201d He took a step nearer to us and lowered his voice. \u201cYou are a wise one, they say, learned in dealing with evil spirits. Let the young master depart from here. There is evil in the air around us.\u201d", "Our meal was hardly a cheerful one. The floor was left to Dr. Tosswill, who discoursed at length upon Egyptian antiquities. Just as we were preparing to retire to rest, Sir Guy caught Poirot by the arm and pointed. A shadowy figure was moving amidst the tents. It was no human one: I recognized distinctly the dog-headed figure I had seen carved on the walls of the tomb.", "He dashed energetically in pursuit of the shadowy apparition. I followed him, but, search as we would, we could find no trace of any living soul having passed that way. We returned, somewhat disturbed in mind, to find Poirot taking energetic measures, in his own way, to ensure his personal safety. He was busily surrounding our tent with various diagrams and inscriptions which he was drawing in the sand. I recognized the five-pointed star or Pentagon many times repeated. As was his wont, Poirot was at the same time delivering an impromptu lecture on witchcraft and magic in general, White Magic as opposed to Black, with various references to the Ka and the Book of the Dead thrown in.", "\u201cBalderdash, sir,\u201d he exclaimed angrily. \u201cPure balderdash. The man\u2019s an impostor. He doesn\u2019t know the difference between the superstitions of the Middle Ages and the beliefs of Ancient Egypt. Never have I heard such a hotch-potch of ignorance and credulity.\u201d", "\u201cWe can now sleep in peace,\u201d he declared happily. \u201cAnd I can do with some sleep. My head, it aches abominably. Ah, for a good _tisane_!\u201d", "As though in answer to prayer, the flap of the tent was lifted and Hassan appeared, bearing a steaming cup which he offered to Poirot. It proved to be camomile tea, a beverage of which he is inordinately fond. Having thanked Hassan and refused his offer of another cup for myself, we were left alone once more. I stood at the door of the tent some time after undressing, looking out over the desert.", "\u201cA wonderful place,\u201d I said aloud, \u201cand a wonderful work. I can feel the fascination. This desert life, this probing into the heart of a vanished civilization. Surely, Poirot, you, too, must feel the charm?\u201d", "I got no answer, and I turned, a little annoyed. My annoyance was quickly changed to concern. Poirot was lying back across the rude couch, his face horribly convulsed. Beside him was the empty cup. I rushed to his side, then dashed out and across the camp to Dr. Ames\u2019s tent.", "\u201cExtraordinary,\u201d cried Ames. \u201cLooks like a seizure\u2014or\u2014what did you say about something he drank?\u201d He picked up the empty cup.", "\u201cNo,\u201d he said gently. \u201cI did not drink it. While my good friend Hastings was apostrophizing the night, I took the opportunity of pouring it, not down my throat, but into a little bottle. That little bottle will go to the analytical chemist. No\u201d\u2014as the doctor made a sudden movement\u2014\u201cas a sensible man, you will understand that violence will be of no avail. During Hastings\u2019 brief absence to fetch you, I have had time to put the bottle in safe keeping. Ah, quick, Hastings, hold him!\u201d", "I misunderstood Poirot\u2019s anxiety. Eager to save my friend, I flung myself in front of him. But the doctor\u2019s swift movement had another meaning. His hand went to his mouth, a smell of bitter almonds filled the air, and he swayed forward and fell.", "\u201cAnother victim,\u201d said Poirot gravely, \u201cbut the last. Perhaps it is the best way. He has three deaths on his head.\u201d", "\u201cYou misunderstood me, Hastings. What I meant was that I believe in the terrific force of superstition. Once get it firmly established that a series of deaths are supernatural, and you might almost stab a man in broad daylight, and it would still be put down to the curse, so strongly is the instinct of the supernatural implanted in the human race. I suspected from the first that a man was taking advantage of that instinct. The idea came to him, I imagine, with the death of Sir John Willard. A fury of superstition arose at once. As far as I could see, nobody could derive any particular profit from Sir John\u2019s death. Mr. Bleibner was a different case. He was a man of great wealth. The information I received from New York contained several suggestive points. To begin with, young Bleibner was reported to have said he had a good friend in Egypt from whom he could borrow. It was tacitly understood that he meant his uncle, but it seemed to me that in that case he would have said so outright. The words suggest some boon companion of his own. Another thing, he scraped up enough money to take him to Egypt, his uncle refused outright to advance him a penny, yet he was able to pay the return passage to New York. Some one must have lent him the money.\u201d", "\u201cBut there was more. Hastings, there occur often enough words spoken metaphorically which are taken literally. The opposite can happen too. In this case, words which were meant literally were taken metaphorically. Young Bleibner wrote plainly enough: \u2018I am a leper,\u2019 but nobody realized that he shot himself because he believed that he had contracted the dread disease of leprosy.\u201d", "\u201cIt was the clever invention of a diabolical mind. Young Bleibner was suffering from some minor skin trouble, he had lived in the South Sea Islands, where the disease is common enough. Ames was a former friend of his, and a well-known medical man, he would never dream of doubting his word. When I arrived here, my suspicions were divided between Harper and Dr. Ames, but I soon realized that only the doctor could have perpetrated and concealed the crimes, and I learnt from Harper that he was previously acquainted with young Bleibner. Doubtless the latter at some time or another had made a will or had insured his life in favour of the doctor. The latter saw his chance of acquiring wealth. It was easy for him to inoculate Mr. Bleibner with the deadly germs. Then the nephew, overcome with despair at the dread news his friend had conveyed to him, shot himself. Mr. Bleibner, whatever his intentions, had made no will. His fortune would pass to his nephew and from him to the doctor.\u201d", "\u201cWe cannot be sure. He knew young Bleibner too, remember, and may have suspected something, or, again, the doctor may have thought that a further death motiveless and purposeless would strengthen the coils of superstition. Furthermore, I will tell you an interesting psychological fact, Hastings. A murderer has always a strong desire to repeat his successful crime, the performance of it grows upon him. Hence my fears for young Willard. The figure of Anubis you saw to-night was Hassan, dressed up by my orders. I wanted to see if I could frighten the doctor. But it would take more than the supernatural to frighten him. I could see that he was not entirely taken in by my pretences of belief in the occult. The little comedy I played for him did not deceive him. I suspected that he would endeavour to make me the next victim. Ah, but in spite of _la mer maudite_, the heat abominable, and the annoyances of the sand, the little grey cells still functioned!\u201d", "Poirot proved to be perfectly right in his premises. Young Bleibner, some years ago, in a fit of drunken merriment, had made a jocular will, leaving \u201cmy cigarette case you admire so much and everything else of which I die possessed which will be principally debts to my good friend Robert Ames who once saved my life from drowning.\u201d", "The case was hushed up as far as possible, and, to this day, people talk of the remarkable series of deaths in connection with the Tomb of Men-her-Ra as a triumphal proof of the vengeance of a bygone king upon the desecrators of his tomb\u2014a belief which, as Poirot pointed out to me, is contrary to all Egyptian belief and thought.", "\u201cBrighton. As a matter of fact, a friend of mine in the City put me on to a very good thing, and\u2014well, I have money to burn, as the saying goes. I think a week-end at the _Grand Metropolitan_ would do us all the good in the world.\u201d", "\u201cThank you, I accept most gratefully. You have the good heart to think of an old man. And the good heart, it is in the end worth all the little grey cells. Yes, yes, I who speak to you am in danger of forgetting that sometimes.\u201d", "I did not quite relish the implication. I fancy that Poirot is sometimes a little inclined to underestimate my mental capacities. But his pleasure was so evident that I put my slight annoyance aside.", "Saturday evening saw us dining at the _Grand Metropolitan_ in the midst of a gay throng. All the world and his wife seemed to be at Brighton. The dresses were marvellous, and the jewels\u2014worn sometimes with more love of display than good taste\u2014were something magnificent.", "\u201c_Hein_, it is a sight this!\u201d murmured Poirot. \u201cThis is the home of the Profiteer, is it not so, Hastings?\u201d", "\u201cThe sight of so many jewels makes me wish I had turned my brains to crime, instead of to its detection. What a magnificent opportunity for some thief of distinction! Regard, Hastings, that stout woman by the pillar. She is, as you would say, plastered with gems.\u201d", "After dinner we ran across the Opalsens in the lounge, and I introduced Poirot to them. We chatted for a few minutes, and ended by having our coffee together.", "Poirot said a few words in praise of some of the costlier gems displayed on the lady\u2019s ample bosom, and she brightened up at once.", "\u201cIt\u2019s a perfect hobby of mine, Mr. Poirot. I just _love_ jewellery. Ed knows my weakness, and every time things go well he brings me something new. You are interested in precious stones?\u201d", "\u201cI have had a good deal to do with them one time and another, madame. My profession has brought me into contact with some of the most famous jewels in the world.\u201d", "He went on to narrate, with discreet pseudonyms, the story of the historic jewels of a reigning house, and Mrs. Opalsen listened with bated breath.", "\u201cThere now!\u201d she exclaimed, as he ended. \u201cIf it isn\u2019t just like a play! You know, I\u2019ve got some pearls of my own that have a history attached to them. I believe it\u2019s supposed to be one of the finest necklaces in the world\u2014the pearls are so beautifully matched and so perfect in colour. I declare I really must run up and get it!\u201d", "The buxom dame waddled across to the lift briskly enough. Her husband, who had been talking to me, looked at Poirot inquiringly.", "\u201cOh, the pearls!\u201d Opalsen smiled in a satisfied fashion. \u201cWell, they _are_ worth seeing. Cost a pretty penny too! Still, the money\u2019s there all right; I could get what I paid for them any day\u2014perhaps more. May have to, too, if things go on as they are now. Money\u2019s confoundedly tight in the City. All this infernal E.P.D.\u201d He rambled on, launching into technicalities where I could not follow him.", "He left us abruptly. Poirot leaned back and lit one of his tiny Russian cigarettes. Then, carefully and meticulously, he arranged the empty coffee-cups in a neat row, and beamed happily on the result.", "\u201cA few moments ago the manager came hurriedly out of his office and ran upstairs. He was much agitated. The lift-boy is deep in talk with one of the pages. The lift-bell has rung three times, but he heeds it not. Thirdly, even the waiters are _distrait_; and to make a waiter _distrait_\u2014\u2014\u201d Poirot shook his head with an air of finality. \u201cThe affair must indeed be of the first magnitude. Ah, it is as I thought! Here come the police.\u201d", "Two men had just entered the hotel\u2014one in uniform, the other in plain clothes. They spoke to a page, and were immediately ushered upstairs. A few minutes later, the same boy descended and came up to where we were sitting.", "Poirot sprang nimbly to his feet. One would have said that he awaited the summons. I followed with no less alacrity.", "The Opalsens\u2019 apartments were situated on the first floor. After knocking on the door, the page-boy retired, and we answered the summons, \u201cCome in!\u201d A strange scene met our eyes. The room was Mrs. Opalsen\u2019s bedroom, and in the centre of it, lying back in an arm-chair, was the lady herself, weeping violently. She presented an extraordinary spectacle, with the tears making great furrows in the powder with which her complexion was liberally coated. Mr. Opalsen was striding up and down angrily. The two police officials stood in the middle of the room, one with a notebook in hand. An hotel chambermaid, looking frightened to death, stood by the fire-place; and on the other side of the room a Frenchwoman, obviously Mrs. Opalsen\u2019s maid, was weeping and wringing her hands, with an intensity of grief that rivalled that of her mistress.", "Into this pandemonium stepped Poirot, neat and smiling. Immediately, with an energy surprising in one of her bulk, Mrs. Opalsen sprang from her chair towards him.", "\u201cThere now; Ed may say what he likes, but I believe in luck, I do. It was fated I should meet you the way I did this evening, and I\u2019ve a feeling that if you can\u2019t get my pearls back for me nobody can.\u201d", "\u201cCalm yourself, I pray of you, madame.\u201d Poirot patted her hand soothingly. \u201cReassure yourself. All will be well. Hercule Poirot will aid you!\u201d", "\u201cNone at all, sir,\u201d replied the man civilly, but with complete indifference. \u201cPerhaps now your lady\u2019s feeling better she\u2019ll just let us have the facts?\u201d", "\u201cI came upstairs after dinner to fetch my pearls for Mr. Poirot here to see. The chambermaid and C\u00e9lestine were both in the room as usual\u2014\u2014\u201d", "\u201cI make it a rule that no one is to come into this room unless C\u00e9lestine, the maid, is there also. The chambermaid does the room in the morning while C\u00e9lestine is present, and comes in after dinner to turn down the beds under the same conditions; otherwise she never enters the room.\u201d", "\u201cWell, as I was saying,\u201d continued Mrs. Opalsen, \u201cI came up. I went to the drawer here,\u201d\u2014she indicated the bottom right-hand drawer of the knee-hole dressing-table\u2014\u201ctook out my jewel-case and unlocked it. It seemed quite as usual\u2014but the pearls were not there!\u201d", "\u201cQuite sure. I was uncertain whether to wear them or not, but in the end I decided on the emeralds, and put them back in the jewel-case.\u201d", "\u201cThe thief must have had a duplicate key. No difficult matter. The lock is quite a simple one. What did you do after you\u2019d locked the jewel-case?\u201d", "\u201cAm I to understand that the jewels were there when you went down to dinner, and that since then _the maid has not left the room_?\u201d", "Suddenly, as though the horror of her own situation for the first time burst upon her, C\u00e9lestine uttered a piercing shriek, and, flinging herself upon Poirot, poured out a torrent of incoherent French.", "The suggestion was infamous! That she should be suspected of robbing Madame! The police were well known to be of a stupidity incredible! But Monsieur, who was a Frenchman\u2014", "Monsieur would not stand by and see her falsely accused, while that infamous chambermaid was allowed to go scot-free. She had never liked her\u2014a bold, red-faced thing\u2014a born thief. She had said from the first that she was not honest. And had kept a sharp watch over her too, when she was doing Madame\u2019s room! Let those idiots of policemen search her, and if they did not find Madame\u2019s pearls on her it would be very surprising!", "Although this harangue was uttered in rapid and virulent French, C\u00e9lestine had interlarded it with a wealth of gesture, and the chambermaid realized at least a part of her meaning. She reddened angrily.", "\u201cIf that foreign woman\u2019s saying I took the pearls, it\u2019s a lie!\u201d she declared heatedly. \u201cI never so much as saw them.\u201d", "\u201cYou\u2019re a liar\u2014do you hear?\u201d said the chambermaid, advancing upon her. \u201cStole \u2019em yourself, and want to put it on me. Why, I was only in the room about three minutes before the lady come up, and then you were sitting here the whole time, as you always do, like a cat watching a mouse.\u201d", "\u201cI did not actually leave her alone,\u201d admitted C\u00e9lestine reluctantly, \u201cbut I went into my own room through the door here twice\u2014once to fetch a reel of cotton, and once for my scissors. She must have done it then.\u201d", "\u201cYou wasn\u2019t gone a minute,\u201d retorted the chambermaid angrily. \u201cJust popped out and in again. I\u2019d be glad if the police _would_ search me. _I\u2019ve nothing to be afraid of_.\u201d", "At this moment there was a tap at the door. The inspector went to it. His face brightened when he saw who it was.", "\u201cAh!\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s rather fortunate. I sent for one of our female searchers, and she\u2019s just arrived. Perhaps if you wouldn\u2019t mind going into the room next door.\u201d", "He looked at the chambermaid, who stepped across the threshold with a toss of her head, the searcher following her closely.", "The French girl had sunk sobbing into a chair. Poirot was looking round the room, the main features of which I have made clear by a sketch.", "\u201cEven if there were,\u201d said the inspector impatiently, \u201cI don\u2019t see how that would help us, if the maid never left the room.\u201d", "\u201cI should hope not, indeed,\u201d said the chambermaid virtuously. \u201cAnd that French hussy ought to be ashamed of herself taking away an honest girl\u2019s character!\u201d", "\u201cThere, there, my girl; that\u2019s all right,\u201d said the inspector, opening the door. \u201cNobody suspects you. You go along and get on with your work.\u201d", "C\u00e9lestine accompanied the searcher into the small room in her turn. A few minutes later she also returned. Nothing had been found on her.", "\u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll have to ask you to come along with me all the same, miss.\u201d He turned to Mrs. Opalsen. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, madam, but all the evidence points that way. If she\u2019s not got them on her, they\u2019re hidden somewhere about the room.\u201d", "C\u00e9lestine uttered a piercing shriek, and clung to Poirot\u2019s arm. The latter bent and whispered something in the girl\u2019s ear. She looked up at him doubtfully.", "\u201c_Si, si, mon enfant_\u2014I assure you it is better not to resist.\u201d Then he turned to the inspector. \u201cYou permit, monsieur? A little experiment\u2014purely for my own satisfaction.\u201d", "\u201cWould it be troubling you too much, mademoiselle, to ask you to repeat those two actions? You were sitting here with your work, you say?\u201d", "C\u00e9lestine sat down, and then, at a sign from Poirot, rose, passed into the adjoining room, took up an object from the chest of drawers, and returned.", "Poirot divided his attention between her movements and a large turnip of a watch which he held in the palm of his hand.", "At the conclusion of the second performance, he made a note in his pocket-book, and returned the watch to his pocket.", "The inspector seemed somewhat entertained by this excessive politeness. C\u00e9lestine departed in a flood of tears, accompanied by the woman and the plain-clothes official.", "Then, with a brief apology to Mrs. Opalsen, the inspector set to work to ransack the room. He pulled out drawers, opened cupboards, completely unmade the bed, and tapped the floor. Mr. Opalsen looked on sceptically.", "\u201cYes, sir. It stands to reason. She hadn\u2019t time to take them out of the room. The lady\u2019s discovering the robbery so soon upset her plans. No, they\u2019re here right enough. One of the two must have hidden them\u2014and it\u2019s very unlikely for the chambermaid to have done so.\u201d", "\u201cI will demonstrate. Hastings, my good friend, take my watch in your hand\u2014with care. It is a family heirloom! Just now I timed Mademoiselle\u2019s movements\u2014her first absence from the room was of twelve seconds, her second of fifteen. Now observe my actions. Madame will have the kindness to give me the key of the jewel-case. I thank you. My friend Hastings will have the kindness to say \u2018Go!\u2019\u201d", "With almost incredible swiftness, Poirot wrenched open the drawer of the dressing-table, extracted the jewel-case, fitted the key in the lock, opened the case, selected a piece of jewellery, shut and locked the case, and returned it to the drawer, which he pushed to again. His movements were like lightning.", "\u201cYou see?\u201d He looked round. \u201cThere would not have been time for the chambermaid even to take the necklace out, far less hide it.\u201d", "\u201cThen that settles it on the maid,\u201d said the inspector with satisfaction, and returned to his search. He passed into the maid\u2019s bedroom next door.", "\u201cBut what does that matter?\u201d broke in Mrs. Opalsen tearfully. \u201cIt\u2019s my necklace I want. It was unique. No money could be the same.\u201d", "\u201cI comprehend, madame,\u201d said Poirot soothingly. \u201cI comprehend perfectly. To _la femme_ sentiment is everything\u2014is it not so? But monsieur, who has not the so fine susceptibility, will doubtless find some slight consolation in the fact.\u201d", "\u201cMaid\u2019s bed. In among the springs of the wire mattress. She must have stolen it and hidden it there before the chambermaid arrived on the scene.\u201d", "\u201cYou permit, madame?\u201d said Poirot gently. He took the necklace from her and examined it closely; then handed it back with a bow.", "\u201cI\u2019m afraid, madam, you\u2019ll have to hand it over to us for the time being,\u201d said the inspector. \u201cWe shall want it for the charge. But it shall be returned to you as soon as possible.\u201d", "\u201cOh, let him take it, Ed!\u201d cried his wife. \u201cI\u2019d feel safer if he did. I shouldn\u2019t sleep a wink thinking some one else might try and get hold of it. That wretched girl! And I would never have believed it of her.\u201d", "The door was not locked, and we entered. The room, which was a large double one, was unoccupied. Dust lay about rather noticeably, and my sensitive friend gave a characteristic grimace as he ran his finger round a rectangular mark on a table near the window.", "\u201c_Je vous demande pardon, mon ami_. I wished to see if the door was really bolted on this side also.\u201d", "\u201cAnd, anyway,\u201d I continued, \u201cwhat does it matter? The case is over. I wish you\u2019d had more chance of distinguishing yourself. But it was the kind of case that even a stiff-backed idiot like that inspector couldn\u2019t go wrong over.\u201d", "\u201cThe case is not over, my friend. It will not be over until we find out who stole the pearls.\u201d", "\u201c_Eh bien_; that poor woman, as you call her, will have a much better night believing the jewels to be safe.\u201d", "\u201cAs usual, my friend, you speak without reflection. How do you know that the pearls Mrs. Opalsen locked up so carefully to-night were not the false ones, and that the real robbery did not take place at a much earlier date?\u201d", "He led the way out of the room, paused a moment as though considering, and then walked down to the end of the corridor, stopping outside the small den where the chambermaids and valets of the respective floors congregated. Our particular chambermaid appeared to be holding a small court there, and to be retailing her late experiences to an appreciative audience. She stopped in the middle of a sentence. Poirot bowed with his usual politeness.", "\u201cExcuse that I derange you, but I shall be obliged if you will unlock for me the door of Mr. Opalsen\u2019s room.\u201d", "The woman rose willingly, and we accompanied her down the passage again. Mr. Opalsen\u2019s room was on the other side of the corridor, its door facing that of his wife\u2019s room. The chambermaid unlocked it with her pass-key, and we entered.", "He held out a plain white card, rather highly glazed and uncommon in appearance. The maid took it and scrutinized it carefully.", "Poirot took back the card. The woman departed. Poirot appeared to reflect a little. Then he gave a short, sharp nod of the head.", "I obeyed, devoured with curiosity. Meanwhile Poirot had emptied the waste-paper-basket on the floor, and was swiftly going through its contents.", "In a few moments the valet answered the bell. To him Poirot put the same question, and handed him the card to examine. But the response was the same. The valet had never seen a card of that particular quality among Mr. Opalsen\u2019s belongings. Poirot thanked him, and he withdrew, somewhat unwillingly, with an inquisitive glance at the overturned waste-paper-basket and the litter on the floor. He could hardly have helped overhearing Poirot\u2019s thoughtful remark as he bundled the torn papers back again:", "\u201cYou see nothing, my friend,\u201d he replied quickly. \u201cAs usual, nothing at all! It is incredible\u2014but there it is. Let us return to our own apartments.\u201d", "\u201cAbsolutely. The real work, that of the brain (ah, those brave little grey cells), it is done. I go to seek the confirmation. I shall find it! Impossible to deceive Hercule Poirot!\u201d", "\u201cDo not be enraged, I beg of you, _mon ami_. I count on you to do me a service\u2014of your friendship.\u201d", "\u201cThe sleeve of my coat that I have taken off\u2014will you brush it? See you, a little white powder has clung to it. You without doubt observed me run my finger round the drawer of the dressing-table?\u201d", "\u201cYou should observe my actions, my friend. Thus I obtained the powder on my finger, and, being a little over-excited, I rubbed it on my sleeve; an action without method which I deplore\u2014false to all my principles.\u201d", "\u201cNot the poison of the Borgias,\u201d replied Poirot, with a twinkle. \u201cI see your imagination mounting. I should say it was French chalk.\u201d", "The door shut behind him. With a smile, half of derision, half of affection, I picked up the coat, and stretched out my hand for the clothes-brush.", "The next morning, hearing nothing from Poirot, I went out for a stroll, met some old friends, and lunched with them at their hotel. In the afternoon we went for a spin. A punctured tyre delayed us, and it was past eight when I got back to the _Grand Metropolitan_.", "The first sight that met my eyes was Poirot, looking even more diminutive than usual, sandwiched between the Opalsens, beaming in a state of placid satisfaction.", "\u201c_Mon ami_ Hastings!\u201d he cried, and sprang to meet me. \u201cEmbrace me, my friend; all has marched to a marvel!\u201d", "\u201cJust wonderful, I call it!\u201d said Mrs. Opalsen, smiling all over her fat face. \u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you, Ed, that if he couldn\u2019t get back my pearls nobody would?\u201d", "\u201cMy friend Hastings is, as you say in England, all at the seaside. Seat yourself, and I will recount to you all the affair that has so happily ended.\u201d", "\u201cCertainly they do\u2014to make drawers slide easily. Somebody wanted that drawer to slide in and out without any noise. Who could that be? Obviously, only the chambermaid. The plan was so ingenious that it did not at once leap to the eye\u2014not even to the eye of Hercule Poirot.", "\u201cListen, this was how it was done. The valet was in the empty room next door, waiting. The French maid leaves the room. Quick as a flash the chambermaid whips open the drawer, takes out the jewel-case, and, slipping back the bolt, passes it through the door. The valet opens it at his leisure with the duplicate key with which he has provided himself, extracts the necklace, and waits his time. C\u00e9lestine leaves the room again, and\u2014pst!\u2014in a flash the case is passed back again and replaced in the drawer.", "\u201cMadame arrives, the theft is discovered. The chambermaid demands to be searched, with a good deal of righteous indignation, and leaves the room without a stain on her character. The imitation necklace with which they have provided themselves has been concealed in the French girl\u2019s bed that morning by the chambermaid\u2014a master stroke, _\u00e7a!_\u201d", "\u201c_Une blague!_ For the benefit of the valet. The card was one with a specially prepared surface\u2014for finger-prints. I went straight to Scotland Yard, asked for our old friend Inspector Japp, and laid the facts before him. As I had suspected, the finger-prints proved to be those of two well-known jewel thieves who have been \u2018wanted\u2019 for some time. Japp came down with me, the thieves were arrested, and the necklace was discovered in the valet\u2019s possession. A clever pair, but they failed in _method_. Have I not told you, Hastings, at least thirty-six times, that without method\u2014\u2014\u201d", "\u201c_Mon ami_, it is a good plan to take a place as chambermaid or valet\u2014but you must not shirk your work. They left an empty room undusted; and therefore, when the man put down the jewel-case on the little table near the communicating door, it left a square mark\u2014\u2014\u201d", "\u201c_Pas du tout_,\u201d replied Poirot tranquilly. \u201cJapp and the local inspector will divide the credit between them. But\u201d\u2014he tapped his pocket\u2014\u201cI have a cheque here, from Mr. Opalsen, and, how say you, my friend? This week-end has not gone according to plan. Shall we return here next week-end\u2014at my expense this time?\u201d", "Now that war and the problems of war are things of the past, I think I may safely venture to reveal to the world the part which my friend Poirot played in a moment of national crisis. The secret has been well guarded. Not a whisper of it reached the Press. But, now that the need for secrecy has gone by, I feel it is only just that England should know the debt it owes to my quaint little friend, whose marvellous brain so ably averted a great catastrophe.", "One evening after dinner\u2014I will not particularize the date; it suffices to say that it was at the time when \u201cPeace by negotiation\u201d was the parrot-cry of England\u2019s enemies\u2014my friend and I were sitting in his rooms. After being invalided out of the Army I had been given a recruiting job, and it had become my custom to drop in on Poirot in the evenings after dinner and talk with him of any cases of interest that he might have on hand.", "I was attempting to discuss with him the sensational news of that day\u2014no less than an attempted assassination of Mr. David MacAdam, England\u2019s Prime Minister. The account in the papers had evidently been carefully censored. No details were given, save that the Prime Minister had had a marvellous escape, the bullet just grazing his cheek.", "I considered that our police must have been shamefully careless for such an outrage to be possible. I could well understand that the German agents in England would be willing to risk much for such an achievement. \u201cFighting Mac,\u201d as his own party had nicknamed him, had strenuously and unequivocally combated the Pacifist influence which was becoming so prevalent.", "He was more than England\u2019s Prime Minister\u2014he _was_ England; and to have removed him from his sphere of influence would have been a crushing and paralysing blow to Britain.", "Poirot was busy mopping a grey suit with a minute sponge. Never was there a dandy such as Hercule Poirot. Neatness and order were his passion. Now, with the odour of benzine filling the air, he was quite unable to give me his full attention.", "\u201cIn a little minute I am with you, my friend. I have all but finished. The spot of grease\u2014he is not good\u2014I remove him\u2014so!\u201d He waved his sponge.", "\u201cI assist a\u2014how do you call it?\u2014\u2018charlady\u2019 to find her husband. A difficult affair, needing the tact. For I have a little idea that when he is found he will not be pleased. What would you? For my part, I sympathize with him. He was a man of discrimination to lose himself.\u201d", "\u201c_Enfantillage!_\u201d replied Poirot promptly. \u201cOne can hardly take it seriously. To fire with the rifle\u2014never does it succeed. It is a device of the past.\u201d", "Poirot shook his head impatiently. He was about to reply when the landlady thrust her head round the door and informed him that there were two gentlemen below who wanted to see him.", "In a few minutes the two visitors were ushered in, and my heart gave a leap as in the foremost I recognized no less a personage than Lord Estair, Leader of the House of Commons; whilst his companion, Mr. Bernard Dodge, was also a member of the War Cabinet, and, as I knew, a close personal friend of the Prime Minister.", "\u201cMonsieur Poirot?\u201d said Lord Estair interrogatively. My friend bowed. The great man looked at me and hesitated. \u201cMy business is private.\u201d", "\u201cYou may speak freely before Captain Hastings,\u201d said my friend, nodding to me to remain. \u201cHe has not all the gifts, no! But I answer for his discretion.\u201d", "\u201cOh, come on\u2014don\u2019t let\u2019s beat about the bush! As far as I can see, the whole of England will know the hole we\u2019re in soon enough. Time\u2019s everything.\u201d", "\u201cMonsieur Poirot, I have come to consult you upon a matter of the most vital urgency. I must ask for absolute secrecy.\u201d", "\u201cAs my colleague says,\u201d continued Lord Estair, \u201cthat affair is over and done with. Luckily, it failed. I wished I could say as much for the second attempt.\u201d", "Poirot looked at Mr. Dodge. \u201cYou said just now, monsieur, that time was everything. What did you mean by that?\u201d", "\u201cFor obvious reasons, no details have been given of when and where it is to take place. But, although it has been kept out of the newspapers, the date is, of course, widely known in diplomatic circles. The Conference is to be held to-morrow\u2014Thursday\u2014evening at Versailles. Now you perceive the terrible gravity of the situation. I will not conceal from you that the Prime Minister\u2019s presence at the Conference is a vital necessity. The Pacifist propaganda, started and maintained by the German agents in our midst, has been very active. It is the universal opinion that the turning point of the Conference will be the strong personality of the Prime Minister. His absence may have the most serious results\u2014possibly a premature and disastrous peace. And we have no one who can be sent in his place. He alone can represent England.\u201d", "Poirot\u2019s face had grown very grave. \u201cThen you regard the kidnapping of the Prime Minister as a direct attempt to prevent his being present at the Conference?\u201d", "\u201cAnd a quarter,\u201d amended Poirot. \u201cDo not forget the quarter, monsieur\u2014it may come in useful. Now for the details\u2014the abduction, did it take place in England or in France?\u201d", "\u201cIn France. Mr. MacAdam crossed to France this morning. He was to stay to-night as the guest of the Commander-in-Chief, proceeding to-morrow to Paris. He was conveyed across the Channel by destroyer. At Boulogne he was met by a car from General Headquarters and one of the Commander-in-Chief\u2019s A.D.C.s.\u201d", "\u201cMonsieur Poirot, it was a bogus car and a bogus A.D.C. The real car was found in a side road, with the chauffeur and the A.D.C. neatly gagged and bound.\u201d", "\u201cSo we thought. It seemed merely a question of searching thoroughly. That part of France is under Military Law. We were convinced that the car could not go long unnoticed. The French police and our own Scotland Yard men, and the military are straining every nerve. It is, as you say, incredible\u2014but nothing has been discovered!\u201d", "At that moment a tap came at the door, and a young officer entered with a heavily sealed envelope which he handed to Lord Estair.", "\u201cHere is news at last! This telegram has just been decoded. They have found the second car, also the secretary, Daniels, chloroformed, gagged, and bound, in an abandoned farm near C\u2014\u2014. He remembers nothing, except something being pressed against his mouth and nose from behind, and struggling to free himself. The police are satisfied as to the genuineness of his statement.\u201d", "\u201cNot the Prime Minister\u2019s dead body? Then, there is hope. But it is strange. Why, after trying to shoot him this morning, are they now taking so much trouble to keep him alive?\u201d", "\u201cIf it is humanly possible, the Prime Minister shall be there. God grant it is not too late. Now, messieurs, recount to me everything\u2014from the beginning. I must know about this shooting affair as well.\u201d", "\u201cYes. As I was saying, they motored down to Windsor, where the Prime Minister was granted an Audience. Early this morning, he returned to town, and it was on the way that the attempted assassination took place.\u201d", "Lord Estair smiled. \u201cI thought you would ask me that. We do not know very much of him. He is of no particular family. He has served in the English Army, and is an extremely able secretary, being an exceptionally fine linguist. I believe he speaks seven languages. It is for that reason that the Prime Minister chose him to accompany him to France.\u201d", "\u201c_Tr\u00e8s bien_. Now I understand, _milord_, that the Prime Minister would, as a matter of course, be under vigilant police protection, which ought to render any assault upon him an impossibility?\u201d", "Lord Estair bowed his head. \u201cThat is so. The Prime Minister\u2019s car was closely followed by another car containing detectives in plain clothes. Mr. MacAdam knew nothing of these precautions. He is personally a most fearless man, and would be inclined to sweep them away arbitrarily. But, naturally, the police make their own arrangements. In fact, the Premier\u2019s chauffeur, O\u2019Murphy, is a C.I.D. man.\u201d", "\u201cThe Premier started for London. The car was a closed one. He and Captain Daniels sat inside. The second car followed as usual. But, unluckily, for some unknown reason, the Prime Minister\u2019s car deviated from the main road\u2014\u2014\u201d", "\u201cFor some unknown reason,\u201d continued Lord Estair, \u201cthe Premier\u2019s car left the main road. The police car, unaware of the deviation, continued to keep to the high road. At a short distance down the unfrequented lane, the Prime Minister\u2019s car was suddenly held up by a band of masked men. The chauffeur\u2014\u2014\u201d", "\u201cThe chauffeur, momentarily taken aback, jammed on the brakes. The Prime Minister put his head out of the window. Instantly a shot rang out\u2014then another. The first one grazed his cheek, the second, fortunately, went wide. The chauffeur, now realizing the danger, instantly forged straight ahead, scattering the band of men.\u201d", "\u201cMr. MacAdam refused to make any fuss over the slight wound he had received. He declared it was only a scratch. He stopped at a local cottage hospital, where it was dressed and bound up\u2014he did not, of course, reveal his identity. He then drove, as per schedule, straight to Charing Cross, where a special train for Dover was awaiting him, and, after a brief account of what had happened had been given to the anxious police by Captain Daniels, he duly departed for France. At Dover, he went on board the waiting destroyer. At Boulogne, as you know, the bogus car was waiting for him, carrying the Union Jack, and correct in every detail.\u201d", "\u201cThe Prime Minister\u2019s car did not return home after leaving the Prime Minister at Charing Cross. The police were anxious to interview O\u2019Murphy, so a search was instituted at once. The car was discovered standing outside a certain unsavoury little restaurant in Soho, which is well known as a meeting-place of German agents.\u201d", "\u201cI can only tell you, Monsieur Poirot, that, if anyone had suggested to me yesterday that O\u2019Murphy was a traitor, I should have laughed in his face.\u201d", "\u201cI understand that I have carte blanche, messieurs\u2014in every way, I mean? I must be able to go where I choose, and how I choose.\u201d", "\u201cPerfectly. There is a special train leaving for Dover in an hour\u2019s time, with a further contingent from Scotland Yard. You shall be accompanied by a Military officer and a C.I.D. man, who will hold themselves at your disposal in every way. Is that satisfactory?\u201d", "\u201cQuite. One more question before you leave, messieurs. What made you come to me? I am unknown, obscure, in this great London of yours.\u201d", "\u201cOne higher than the _Pr\u00e9fet_. One whose word was once law in Belgium\u2014and shall be again! That England has sworn!\u201d", "Poirot\u2019s hand flew swiftly to a dramatic salute. \u201cAmen to that! Ah, but my Master does not forget. . . . Messieurs, I, Hercule Poirot, will serve you faithfully. Heaven only send that it will be in time. But this is dark\u2014dark. . . . I cannot see.\u201d", "\u201cPardon me, _mon ami_, but I did not quite say that. It is undoubtedly far more their affair to kidnap him.\u201d", "\u201cBecause uncertainty creates panic. That is one reason. Were the Prime Minister dead, it would be a terrible calamity, but the situation would have to be faced. But now you have paralysis. Will the Prime Minister reappear, or will he not? Is he dead or alive? Nobody knows, and until they know nothing definite can be done. And, as I tell you, uncertainty breeds panic, which is what _les Boches_ are playing for. Then, again, if the kidnappers are holding him secretly somewhere, they have the advantage of being able to make terms with both sides. The German Government is not a liberal paymaster, as a rule, but no doubt they can be made to disgorge substantial remittances in such a case as this. Thirdly, they run no risk of the hangman\u2019s rope. Oh, decidedly, kidnapping is their affair.\u201d", "Poirot made a gesture of anger. \u201cAh, that is just what I do not understand! It is inexplicable\u2014stupid! They have all their arrangements made (and very good arrangements too!) for the abduction, and yet they imperil the whole affair by a melodramatic attack, worthy of a Cinema, and quite as unreal. It is almost impossible to believe in it, with its band of masked men, not twenty miles from London!\u201d", "\u201cAh, no, that would be too much of a coincidence! Then, further\u2014who is the traitor? There must have been a traitor\u2014in the first affair, anyway. But who was it\u2014Daniels or O\u2019Murphy? It must have been one of the two, or why did the car leave the main road? We cannot suppose that the Prime Minister connived at his own assassination! Did O\u2019Murphy take that turning of his own accord, or was it Daniels who told him to do so?\u201d", "\u201cYes, because if it was Daniels\u2019 the Prime Minister would have heard the order, and would have asked the reason. But there are altogether too many \u2018whys\u2019 in this affair, and they contradict each other. If O\u2019Murphy is an honest man, _why_ did he leave the main road? But if he was a dishonest man, _why_ did he start the car again when only two shots had been fired\u2014thereby, in all probability, saving the Prime Minister\u2019s life? And, again, if he was honest, why did he, immediately on leaving Charing Cross, drive to a well-known rendezvous of German spies?\u201d", "\u201cLet us look at the case with method. What have we for and against these two men? Take O\u2019Murphy first. Against: that his conduct in leaving the main road was suspicious; that he is an Irishman from County Clare; that he has disappeared in a highly suggestive manner. For: that his promptness in restarting the car saved the Premier\u2019s life; that he is a Scotland Yard man, and, obviously, from the post allotted to him, a trusted detective. Now for Daniels. There is not much against him, except the fact that nothing is known of his antecedents, and that he speaks too many languages for a good Englishman! (Pardon me, _mon ami_, but, as linguists, you are deplorable!) _Now for him_, we have the fact that he was found gagged, bound, and chloroformed\u2014which does not look as though he had anything to do with the matter.\u201d", "Poirot shook his head. \u201cThe French police would make no mistake of that kind. Besides, once he had attained his object, and the Prime Minister was safely abducted, there would not be much point in his remaining behind. His accomplices _could_ have gagged and chloroformed him, of course, but I fail to see what object they hoped to accomplish by it. He can be of little use to them now, for, until the circumstances concerning the Prime Minister have been cleared up, he is bound to be closely watched.\u201d", "\u201cThen why did he not do so? He merely says that something was pressed over his nose and mouth, and that he remembers nothing more. There is no false scent there. It sounds remarkably like the truth.\u201d", "\u201cWell,\u201d I said, glancing at the clock, \u201cI suppose we\u2019d better start for the station. You may find more clues in France.\u201d", "\u201cPossibly, _mon ami_, but I doubt it. It is still incredible to me that the Prime Minister has not been discovered in that limited area, where the difficulty of concealing him must be tremendous. If the military and the police of two countries have not found him, how shall I?\u201d", "\u201cThis is Detective Barnes, of Scotland Yard, and Major Norman. They will hold themselves entirely at your disposal. Good luck to you. It\u2019s a bad business, but I\u2019ve not given up hope. Must be off now.\u201d And the Minister strode rapidly away.", "We chatted in a desultory fashion with Major Norman. In the centre of the little group of men on the platform I recognized a little ferret-faced fellow talking to a tall, fair man. He was an old acquaintance of Poirot\u2019s\u2014Detective-Inspector Japp, supposed to be one of the smartest of Scotland Yard\u2019s officers. He came over and greeted my friend cheerfully.", "\u201cI heard you were on this job too. Smart bit of work. So far they\u2019ve got away with the goods all right. But I can\u2019t believe they can keep him hidden long. Our people are going through France with a toothcomb. So are the French. I can\u2019t help feeling it\u2019s only a matter of hours now.\u201d", "Poirot nodded. \u201cYes, yes; he\u2019s alive. But can he be found in time? I, like you, did not believe he could be hidden so long.\u201d", "The whistle blew, and we all trooped up into the Pullman car. Then, with a slow, unwilling jerk, the train drew out of the station.", "It was a curious journey. The Scotland Yard men crowded together. Maps of Northern France were spread out, and eager forefingers traced the lines of roads and villages. Each man had his own pet theory. Poirot showed none of his usual loquacity, but sat staring in front of him, with an expression on his face that reminded me of a puzzled child. I talked to Norman, whom I found quite an amusing fellow. On arriving at Dover Poirot\u2019s behaviour moved me to intense amusement. The little man, as he went on board the boat, clutched desperately at my arm. The wind was blowing lustily.", "\u201cAh, _mon ami_, you mistake my emotion. It is this villainous sea that troubles me! The _mal de mer_\u2014it is horrible suffering!\u201d", "\u201cBut no, but no! Leave me, my friend. See you, to think, the stomach and the brain must be in harmony. Laverguier has a method most excellent for averting the _mal de mer_. You breathe in\u2014and out\u2014slowly, so\u2014turning the head from left to right and counting six between each breath.\u201d", "As we came slowly into Boulogne Harbour Poirot appeared, neat and smiling, and announced to me in a whisper that Laverguier\u2019s system had succeeded \u201cto a marvel!\u201d", "Japp\u2019s forefinger was still tracing imaginary routes on his map. \u201cNonsense! The car started from Boulogne\u2014here they branched off. Now, my idea is that they transferred the Prime Minister to another car. See?\u201d", "\u201cWell,\u201d said the tall detective, \u201cI shall make for the seaports. Ten to one, they\u2019ve smuggled him on board a ship.\u201d", "The day was just breaking as we landed. Major Norman touched Poirot on the arm. \u201cThere\u2019s a military car here waiting for you, sir.\u201d", "He suited the action to the word, demanded and was accorded a private room. We three followed him, puzzled and uncomprehending.", "He shot a quick glance at us. \u201cIt is not so that the good detective should act, eh? I perceive your thought. He must be full of energy. He must rush to and fro. He should prostrate himself on the dusty road and seek the marks of tyres through a little glass. He must gather up the cigarette-end, the fallen match? That is your idea, is it not?\u201d", "His eyes challenged us. \u201cBut I\u2014Hercule Poirot\u2014tell you that it is not so! The true clues are within\u2014_here_!\u201d He tapped his forehead. \u201cSee you, I need not have left London. It would have been sufficient for me to sit quietly in my rooms there. All that matters is the little grey cells within. Secretly and silently they do their part, until suddenly I call for a map, and I lay my finger on a spot\u2014so\u2014and I say: the Prime Minister is _there_! And it is so! With method and logic one can accomplish anything! This frantic rushing to France was a mistake\u2014it is playing a child\u2019s game of hide-and-seek. But now, though it may be too late, I will set to work the right way, from within. Silence, my friends, I beg of you.\u201d", "And for five long hours the little man sat motionless, blinking his eyelids like a cat, his green eyes flickering and becoming steadily greener and greener. The Scotland Yard man was obviously contemptuous, Major Norman was bored and impatient, and I myself found the time pass with wearisome slowness.", "Finally, I got up, and strolled as noiselessly as I could to the window. The matter was becoming a farce. I was secretly concerned for my friend. If he failed, I would have preferred him to fail in a less ridiculous manner. Out of the window I idly watched the daily leave boat, belching forth columns of smoke, as she lay alongside the quay.", "I turned. An extraordinary transformation had come over my friend. His eyes were flickering with excitement, his chest was swelled to the uttermost.", "\u201cYes. To work with method, one must begin from the beginning. And the beginning of this affair was in England. Therefore, we return to England.\u201d", "At three o\u2019clock, we stood once more upon Charing Cross platform. To all our expostulations, Poirot turned a deaf ear, and reiterated again and again that to start at the beginning was not a waste of time, but the only way. On the way over, he had conferred with Norman in a low voice, and the latter had despatched a sheaf of telegrams from Dover.", "Owing to the special passes held by Norman, we got through everywhere in record time. In London, a large police car was waiting for us, with some plain-clothes men, one of whom handed a typewritten sheet of paper to my friend. He answered my inquiring glance.", "We were whirled rapidly through the London streets. We were on the Bath Road. On we went, through Hammersmith, Chiswick and Brentford. I began to see our objective. Through Windsor and on to Ascot. My heart gave a leap. Ascot was where Daniels had an aunt living. We were after _him_, then, not O\u2019Murphy.", "We duly stopped at the gate of a trim villa. Poirot jumped out and rang the bell. I saw a perplexed frown dimming the radiance of his face. Plainly, he was not satisfied. The bell was answered. He was ushered inside. In a few moments he reappeared, and climbed into the car with a short, sharp shake of his head. My hopes began to die down. It was past four now. Even if he found certain evidence incriminating Daniels, what would be the good of it, unless he could wring from some one the exact spot in France where they were holding the Prime Minister?", "Our return progress towards London was an interrupted one. We deviated from the main road more than once, and occasionally stopped at a small building, which I had no difficulty in recognizing as a cottage hospital. Poirot only spent a few minutes at each, but at every halt his radiant assurance was more and more restored.", "We turned up a side road, and in the failing light I discerned a second car, waiting by the side of the road. It contained two men in plain clothes. Poirot got down and spoke to them, and then we started off in a northerly direction, the other car following close behind.", "We drove for some time, our objective being obviously one of the northern suburbs of London. Finally, we drove up to the front door of a tall house, standing a little back from the road in its own grounds.", "Norman and I were left with the car. Poirot and one of the detectives went up to the door and rang. A neat parlourmaid opened it. The detective spoke.", "But Poirot swiftly inserted his foot in the door, and at the same moment blew a whistle. Instantly the other detectives ran up, and poured into the house, shutting the door behind them.", "Norman and I spent about five minutes cursing our forced inactivity. Finally the door reopened, and the men emerged, escorting three prisoners\u2014a woman and two men. The woman, and one of the men, were taken to the second car. The other man was placed in our car by Poirot himself.", "\u201cI must go with the others, my friend. But have great care of this gentleman. You do not know him, no? _Eh bien_, let me present to you, Monsieur O\u2019Murphy!\u201d", "O\u2019Murphy! I _gaped_ at him open-mouthed as we started again. He was not handcuffed, but I did not fancy he would try to escape. He sat there staring in front of him as though dazed. Anyway, Norman and I would be more than a match for him.", "To my surprise, we still kept a northerly route. We were not returning to London, then! I was much puzzled. Suddenly, as the car slowed down, I recognized that we were close to Hendon Aerodrome. Immediately I grasped Poirot\u2019s idea. He proposed to reach France by aeroplane.", "It was a sporting idea, but, on the face of it, impracticable. A telegram would be far quicker. Time was everything. He must leave the personal glory of rescuing the Prime Minister to others.", "As we drew up, Major Norman jumped out, and a plain-clothes man took his place. He conferred with Poirot for a few minutes, and then went off briskly.", "\u201cI congratulate you, old fellow! They have told you the hiding-place? But, look here, you must wire to France at once. You\u2019ll be too late if you go yourself.\u201d", "Poirot was consulting his enormous watch. He murmured to himself: \u201cYes, there is time\u2014just time.\u201d Then he looked up, and bowed politely to the young officer. \u201cI thank you, monsieur. But it is not I who am your passenger. It is this gentleman here.\u201d", "He moved a little aside as he spoke, and a figure came forward out of the darkness. It was the second male prisoner who had gone in the other car, and as the light fell on his face, I gave a gasp of surprise.", "\u201cFor Heaven\u2019s sake, tell me all about it,\u201d I cried impatiently, as Poirot, Norman, and I motored back to London. \u201cHow in the world did they manage to smuggle him back to England?\u201d", "\u201cThere was no need to smuggle him back,\u201d replied Poirot dryly. \u201cThe Prime Minister has never left England. He was kidnapped on his way from Windsor to London.\u201d", "\u201cI will make all clear. The Prime Minister was in his car, his secretary beside him. Suddenly a pad of chloroform is clapped on his face\u2014\u2014\u201d", "\u201cBy the clever linguistic Captain Daniels. As soon as the Prime Minister is unconscious, Daniels picks up the speaking-tube, and directs O\u2019Murphy to turn to the right, which the chauffeur, quite unsuspicious, does. A few yards down that unfrequented road, a large car is standing, apparently broken down. Its driver signals to O\u2019Murphy to stop. O\u2019Murphy slows up. The stranger approaches. Daniels leans out of the window, and, probably with the aid of an instantaneous an\u00e6sthetic, such as ethylchloride, the chloroform trick is repeated. In a few seconds, the two helpless men are dragged out and transferred to the other car, and a pair of substitutes take their places.\u201d", "\u201c_Pas du tout!_ Have you not seen music-hall turns imitating celebrities with marvellous accuracy? Nothing is easier than to personate a public character. The Prime Minister of England is far easier to understudy than Mr. John Smith of Clapham, say. As for O\u2019Murphy\u2019s \u2018double,\u2019 no one was going to take much notice of him until after the departure of the Prime Minister, and by then he would have made himself scarce. He drives straight from Charing Cross to the meeting-place of his friends. He goes in as O\u2019Murphy, he emerges as some one quite different. O\u2019Murphy has disappeared, leaving a conveniently suspicious trail behind him.\u201d", "\u201cHe was not seen by anyone who knew him privately or intimately. And Daniels shielded him from contact with anyone as much as possible. Moreover, his face was bandaged up, and anything unusual in his manner would be put down to the fact that he was suffering from shock as a result of the attempt upon his life. Mr. MacAdam has a weak throat, and always spares his voice as much as possible before any great speech. The deception was perfectly easy to keep up as far as France. There it would be impracticable and impossible\u2014so the Prime Minister disappears. The police of this country hurry across the Channel, and no one bothers to go into the details of the first attack. To sustain the illusion that the abduction has taken place in France, Daniels is gagged and chloroformed in a convincing manner.\u201d", "\u201cRids himself of his disguise. He and the bogus chauffeur may be arrested as suspicious characters, but no one will dream of suspecting their real part in the drama, and they will eventually be released for lack of evidence.\u201d", "\u201cHe and O\u2019Murphy were driven straight to the house of \u2018Mrs. Everard,\u2019 at Hampstead, Daniels\u2019 so-called \u2018aunt.\u2019 In reality, she is Frau Bertha Ebenthal, and the police have been looking for her for some time. It is a valuable little present that I have made to them\u2014to say nothing of Daniels! Ah, it was a clever plan, but he did not reckon on the cleverness of Hercule Poirot!\u201d", "\u201cWhen I began to work the right way\u2014from _within_! I could not make that shooting affair fit in\u2014but when I saw that the net result of it was that _the Prime Minister went to France with his face bound up_ I began to comprehend! And when I visited all the cottage hospitals between Windsor and London, and found that no one answering to my description had had his face bound up and dressed that morning, I was sure! After that, it was child\u2019s-play for a mind like mine!\u201d", "The following morning, Poirot showed me a telegram he had just received. It had no place of origin, and was unsigned. It ran:", "Later in the day the evening papers published an account of the Allied Conference. They laid particular stress on the magnificent ovation accorded to Mr. David MacAdam, whose inspiring speech had produced a deep and lasting impression.", "Poirot and I were expecting our old friend Inspector Japp of Scotland Yard to tea. We were sitting round the tea-table awaiting his arrival. Poirot had just finished carefully straightening the cups and saucers which our landlady was in the habit of throwing, rather than placing, on the table. He had also breathed heavily on the metal teapot, and polished it with a silk handkerchief. The kettle was on the boil, and a small enamel saucepan beside it contained some thick, sweet chocolate which was more to Poirot\u2019s palate than what he described as \u201cyour English poison.\u201d A sharp \u201crat-tat\u201d sounded below, and a few minutes afterwards Japp entered briskly.", "\u201cHope I\u2019m not late,\u201d he said as he greeted us. \u201cTo tell the truth, I was yarning with Miller, the man who\u2019s in charge of the Davenheim case.\u201d", "I pricked up my ears. For the last three days the papers had been full of the strange disappearance of Mr. Davenheim, senior partner of Davenheim and Salmon, the well-known bankers and financiers. On Saturday last he had walked out of his house, and had never been seen since. I looked forward to extracting some interesting details from Japp.", "\u201cBut certainly they are! They fall into three categories: First, and most common, the voluntary disappearance. Second, the much abused \u2018loss of memory\u2019 case\u2014rare, but occasionally genuine. Third, murder, and a more or less successful disposal of the body. Do you refer to all three as impossible of execution?\u201d", "\u201cVery nearly so, I should think. You might lose your own memory, but some one would be sure to recognize you\u2014especially in the case of a well-known man like Davenheim. Then \u2018bodies\u2019 can\u2019t be made to vanish into thin air. Sooner or later they turn up, concealed in lonely places, or in trunks. Murder will out. In the same way, the absconding clerk, or the domestic defaulter, is bound to be run down in these days of wireless telegraphy. He can be headed off from foreign countries; ports and railway stations are watched; and, as for concealment in this country, his features and appearance will be known to every one who reads a daily newspaper. He\u2019s up against civilization.\u201d", "\u201c_Mon ami_,\u201d said Poirot, \u201cyou make one error. You do not allow for the fact that a man who had decided to make away with another man\u2014or with himself in a figurative sense\u2014might be that rare machine, a man of method. He might bring intelligence, talent, a careful calculation of detail to the task; and then I do not see why he should not be successful in baffling the police force.\u201d", "Poirot endeavoured, with a marked lack of success, to look modest. \u201cMe, also! Why not? It is true that I approach such problems with an exact science, a mathematical precision, which seems, alas, only too rare in the new generation of detectives!\u201d", "\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cMiller, the man who\u2019s on this case, is a smart chap. You may be very sure he won\u2019t overlook a footprint, or a cigar-ash, or a crumb even. He\u2019s got eyes that see everything.\u201d", "\u201cSo, _mon ami_,\u201d said Poirot, \u201chas the London sparrow. But all the same, I should not ask the little brown bird to solve the problem of Mr. Davenheim.\u201d", "\u201cBy no means. These things are all good in their way. The danger is they may assume undue importance. Most details are insignificant; one or two are vital. It is the brain, the little grey cells\u201d\u2014he tapped his forehead\u2014\u201con which one must rely. The senses mislead. One must seek the truth within\u2014not without.\u201d", "\u201cYou don\u2019t mean to say, Monsieur Poirot, that you would undertake to solve a case without moving from your chair, do you?\u201d", "\u201cThat is exactly what I do mean\u2014granted the facts were placed before me. I regard myself as a consulting specialist.\u201d", "Japp slapped his knee. \u201cHanged if I don\u2019t take you at your word. Bet you a fiver that you can\u2019t lay your hand\u2014or rather tell me where to lay my hand\u2014on Mr. Davenheim, dead or alive, before a week is out.\u201d", "\u201cOn Saturday last, as is his usual custom, Mr. Davenheim took the 12.40 train from Victoria to Chingside, where his palatial country place, The Cedars, is situated. After lunch, he strolled round the grounds, and gave various directions to the gardeners. Everybody agrees that his manner was absolutely normal and as usual. After tea he put his head into his wife\u2019s boudoir, saying that he was going to stroll down to the village and post some letters. He added that he was expecting a Mr. Lowen, on business. If he should come before he himself returned, he was to be shown into the study and asked to wait. Mr. Davenheim then left the house by the front door, passed leisurely down the drive, and out at the gate, and\u2014was never seen again. From that hour, he vanished completely.\u201d", "\u201cAbout a quarter of an hour later a tall, dark man with a thick black moustache rang the front-door bell, and explained that he had an appointment with Mr. Davenheim. He gave the name of Lowen, and in accordance with the banker\u2019s instructions was shown into the study. Nearly an hour passed. Mr. Davenheim did not return. Finally Mr. Lowen rang the bell, and explained that he was unable to wait any longer, as he must catch his train back to town. Mrs. Davenheim apologized for her husband\u2019s absence, which seemed unaccountable, as she knew him to have been expecting the visitor. Mr. Lowen reiterated his regrets and took his departure.", "\u201cWell, as every one knows, Mr. Davenheim did not return. Early on Sunday morning the police were communicated with, but could make neither head nor tail of the matter. Mr. Davenheim seemed literally to have vanished into thin air. He had not been to the post office; nor had he been seen passing through the village. At the station they were positive he had not departed by any train. His own motor had not left the garage. If he had hired a car to meet him in some lonely spot, it seems almost certain that by this time, in view of the large reward offered for information, the driver of it would have come forward to tell what he knew. True, there was a small race-meeting at Entfield, five miles away, and if he had walked to that station he might have passed unnoticed in the crowd. But since then his photograph and a full description of him have been circulated in every newspaper, and nobody has been able to give any news of him. We have, of course, received many letters from all over England, but each clue, so far, has ended in disappointment.", "\u201cOn Monday morning a further sensational discovery came to light. Behind a porti\u00e8re in Mr. Davenheim\u2019s study stands a safe, and that safe had been broken into and rifled. The windows were fastened securely on the inside, which seems to put an ordinary burglary out of court, unless, of course, an accomplice within the house fastened them again afterwards. On the other hand, Sunday having intervened, and the household being in a state of chaos, it is likely that the burglary was committed on the Saturday, and remained undetected until Monday.\u201d", "\u201cWe\u2019ve been going into that with the junior partner of the firm and Mrs. Davenheim. Apparently there was a considerable amount in bearer bonds, and a very large sum in notes, owing to some large transaction having been just carried through. There was also a small fortune in jewellery. All Mrs. Davenheim\u2019s jewels were kept in the safe. The purchasing of them had become a passion with her husband of late years, and hardly a month passed that he did not make her a present of some rare and costly gem.\u201d", "\u201cAltogether a good haul,\u201d said Poirot thoughtfully. \u201cNow, what about Lowen? Is it known what his business was with Davenheim that evening?\u201d", "\u201cWell, the two men were apparently not on very good terms. Lowen is a speculator in quite a small way. Nevertheless, he has been able once or twice to score a _coup_ off Davenheim in the market, though it seems they seldom or never actually met. It was a matter concerning some South American shares which led the banker to make his appointment.\u201d", "\u201cI should say his domestic life was quite peaceful and uneventful. Mrs. Davenheim is a pleasant, rather unintelligent woman. Quite a nonentity, I think.\u201d", "\u201cHe had plenty of financial rivals, and no doubt there are many people whom he has got the better of who bear him no particular good-will. But there was no one likely to make away with him\u2014and, if they had, where is the body?\u201d", "\u201cBy the way, one of the gardeners says he saw a figure going round to the side of the house toward the rose-garden. The long French window of the study opens on to the rose-garden, and Mr. Davenheim frequently entered and left the house that way. But the man was a good way off, at work on some cucumber frames, and cannot even say whether it was the figure of his master or not. Also, he cannot fix the time with any accuracy. It must have been before six, as the gardeners cease work at that time.\u201d", "\u201cYes, a couple of punts are kept there. I suppose you\u2019re thinking of suicide, Monsieur Poirot? Well, I don\u2019t mind telling you that Miller\u2019s going down to-morrow expressly to see that piece of water dragged. That\u2019s the kind of man he is!\u201d", "Poirot smiled faintly, and turned to me. \u201cHastings, I pray you, hand me that copy of the _Daily Megaphone_. If I remember rightly, there is an unusually clear photograph there of the missing man.\u201d", "\u201cI find it a good sign when a case is obscure. If a thing is clear as daylight\u2014_eh bien_, mistrust it! Some one has made it so.\u201d", "Japp shook his head almost pityingly. \u201cWell, each to their fancy. But it\u2019s not a bad thing to see your way clear ahead.\u201d", "\u201cAnd you will bring me any fresh developments that arise\u2014the result of the labours of the hard-working and lynx-eyed Inspector Miller, for instance?\u201d", "\u201cSeems a shame, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d said Japp to me as I accompanied him to the door. \u201cLike robbing a child!\u201d", "\u201c_Eh bien!_\u201d said Poirot immediately. \u201cYou make fun of Papa Poirot, is it not so?\u201d He shook his finger at me. \u201cYou do not trust his grey cells? Ah, do not be confused! Let us discuss this little problem\u2014incomplete as yet, I admit, but already showing one or two points of interest.\u201d", "I looked sidewise at Poirot. He was smiling in his most inscrutable fashion. I felt that, for the moment, it would be quite useless to question him further.", "We heard nothing of Japp until the following evening, when he walked in about nine o\u2019clock. I saw at once by his expression that he was bursting with news of some kind.", "\u201c_Eh bien_, my friend,\u201d remarked Poirot. \u201cAll goes well? But do not tell me that you have discovered the body of Mr. Davenheim in your lake, because I shall not believe you.\u201d", "\u201cWe haven\u2019t found the body, but we did find his _clothes_\u2014the identical clothes he was wearing that day. What do you say to that?\u201d", "\u201cNo, his valet is quite positive on that point. The rest of his wardrobe is intact. There\u2019s more. We\u2019ve arrested Lowen. One of the maids, whose business it is to fasten the bedroom windows, declares that she saw Lowen coming _towards_ the study through the rose-garden about a quarter past six. That would be about ten minutes before he left the house.\u201d", "\u201cDenied first of all that he had ever left the study. But the maid was positive, and he pretended afterwards that he had forgotten just stepping out of the window to examine an unusual species of rose. Rather a weak story! And there\u2019s fresh evidence against him come to light. Mr. Davenheim always wore a thick gold ring set with a solitaire diamond on the little finger of his right hand. Well, that ring was pawned in London on Saturday night by a man called Billy Kellett! He\u2019s already known to the police\u2014did three months last autumn for lifting an old gentleman\u2019s watch. It seems he tried to pawn the ring at no less than five different places, succeeded at the last one, got gloriously drunk on the proceeds, assaulted a policeman, and was run in in consequence. I went to Bow Street with Miller and saw him. He\u2019s sober enough now, and I don\u2019t mind admitting we pretty well frightened the life out of him, hinting he might be charged with murder. This is his yarn, and a very queer one it is.", "\u201cHe was at Entfield races on Saturday, though I dare say scarfpins was his line of business, rather than betting. Anyway, he had a bad day, and was down on his luck. He was tramping along the road to Chingside, and sat down in a ditch to rest just before he got into the village. A few minutes later he noticed a man coming along the road to the village, \u2018dark-complexioned gent, with a big moustache, one of them city toffs,\u2019 is his description of the man.", "\u201cKellett was half concealed from the road by a heap of stones. Just before he got abreast of him, the man looked quickly up and down the road, and seeing it apparently deserted he took a small object from his pocket and threw it over the hedge. Then he went on towards the station. Now, the object he had thrown over the hedge had fallen with a slight \u2018chink\u2019 which aroused the curiosity of the human derelict in the ditch. He investigated and, after a short search, discovered the ring! That is Kellett\u2019s story. It\u2019s only fair to say that Lowen denies it utterly, and of course the word of a man like Kellett can\u2019t be relied upon in the slightest. It\u2019s within the bounds of possibility that he met Davenheim in the lane and robbed and murdered him.\u201d", "\u201cVery improbable, _mon ami_. He had no means of disposing of the body. It would have been found by now. Secondly, the open way in which he pawned the ring makes it unlikely that he did murder to get it. Thirdly, your sneak-thief is rarely a murderer. Fourthly, as he has been in prison since Saturday, it would be too much of a coincidence that he is able to give so accurate a description of Lowen.\u201d", "Japp nodded. \u201cI don\u2019t say you\u2019re not right. But all the same, you won\u2019t get a jury to take much note of a jailbird\u2019s evidence. What seems odd to me is that Lowen couldn\u2019t find a cleverer way of disposing of the ring.\u201d", "Poirot shrugged his shoulders. \u201cWell, after all, if it were found in the neighbourhood, it might be argued that Davenheim himself had dropped it.\u201d", "\u201cThere might be a reason for that,\u201d said Japp. \u201cDo you know that just beyond the lake, a little gate leads out on to the hill, and not three minutes\u2019 walk brings you to\u2014what do you think?\u2014a _lime kiln_.\u201d", "\u201cGood heavens!\u201d I cried. \u201cYou mean that the lime which destroyed the body would be powerless to affect the metal of the ring?\u201d", "By common consent we both turned and looked at Poirot. He seemed lost in reflection, his brow knitted, as though with some supreme mental effort. I felt that at last his keen intellect was asserting itself. What would his first words be? We were not long left in doubt. With a sigh, the tension of his attitude relaxed, and turning to Japp, he asked:", "The question seemed so ludicrously inappropriate that for a moment we both stared in silence. Then Japp burst into a laugh. \u201cGood Lord, Monsieur Poirot, I thought you were coming out with something startling. As to your question, I\u2019m sure I don\u2019t know.\u201d", "Japp stared at him a few minutes longer, but Poirot seemed to have forgotten us both. The detective shook his head sadly at me, and murmuring, \u201cPoor old fellow! War\u2019s been too much for him!\u201d gently withdrew from the room.", "As Poirot still seemed sunk in a daydream, I took a sheet of paper, and amused myself by scribbling notes upon it. My friend\u2019s voice aroused me. He had come out of his reverie, and was looking brisk and alert.", "Poirot looked at me pityingly, shaking his head very gently. \u201c_Mon pauvre ami!_ But it is that you have not the gift! The important detail, you appreciate him never! Also, your reasoning is false.\u201d", "\u201cOne: Mr. Lowen could not possibly know that he would have the chance to open the safe. He came for a business interview. He could not know beforehand that Mr. Davenheim would be absent posting a letter, and that he would consequently be alone in the study!\u201d", "\u201cAnd the tools? City gentlemen do not carry round housebreaker\u2019s tools on the off chance! And one could not cut into that safe with a penknife, _bien entendu_!\u201d", "\u201cYou say Lowen had a grudge against Mr. Davenheim. What you mean is that he had once or twice got the better of him. And presumably those transactions were entered into with the view of benefiting himself. In any case you do not as a rule bear a grudge against a man you have got the better of\u2014it is more likely to be the other way about. Whatever grudge there might have been would have been on Mr. Davenheim\u2019s side.\u201d", "\u201cNo. But he may have been frightened. Remember, the missing man\u2019s clothes had just been discovered in the lake. Of course, as usual, he would have done better to speak the truth.\u201d", "\u201cI grant you that. If Kellett\u2019s story is true, Lowen is undeniably implicated. That is what makes the affair so very interesting.\u201d", "\u201cPerhaps\u2014but you have entirely overlooked the two most important points, the ones which undoubtedly hold the clue to the whole matter.\u201d", "\u201cOne, the passion which has grown upon Mr. Davenheim in the last few years for buying jewellery. Two, his trip to Buenos Ayres last autumn.\u201d", "But the detective, entering into the spirit of the joke, had remembered it so well that a telegram was handed to Poirot about eleven o\u2019clock the next day. At his request I opened it and read it out:", "\u201cI expect a big smash in a few days\u2014perhaps sooner. Which reminds me, we will return the compliment of a _d\u00e9p\u00eache_ to Japp. A pencil, I pray you, and a form. _Voil\u00e0!_ \u2018Advise you to withdraw any money deposited with firm in question.\u2019 That will intrigue him, the good Japp! His eyes will open wide\u2014wide! He will not comprehend in the slightest\u2014until to-morrow, or the next day!\u201d", "I remained sceptical, but the morrow forced me to render tribute to my friend\u2019s remarkable powers. In every paper was a huge headline telling of the sensational failure of the Davenheim bank. The disappearance of the famous financier took on a totally different aspect in the light of the revelation of the financial affairs of the bank.", "Before we were half-way through breakfast, the door flew open and Japp rushed in. In his left hand was a paper; in his right was Poirot\u2019s telegram, which he banged down on the table in front of my friend.", "Poirot smiled placidly at him. \u201cAh, _mon ami_, after your wire, it was a certainty! From the commencement, see you, it struck me that the safe burglary was somewhat remarkable. Jewels, ready money, bearer bonds\u2014all so conveniently arranged for\u2014whom? Well, the good Monsieur Davenheim was of those who \u2018look after Number One\u2019 as your saying goes! It seemed almost certain that it was arranged for\u2014himself! Then his passion of late years for buying jewellery! How simple! The funds he embezzled, he converted into jewels, very likely replacing them in turn with paste duplicates, and so he put away in a safe place, under another name, a considerable fortune to be enjoyed all in good time when every one has been thrown off the track. His arrangements completed, he makes an appointment with Mr. Lowen (who has been imprudent enough in the past to cross the great man once or twice), drills a hole in the safe, leaves orders that the guest is to be shown into the study, and walks out of the house\u2014where?\u201d Poirot stopped, and stretched out his hand for another boiled egg. He frowned. \u201cIt is really insupportable,\u201d he murmured, \u201cthat every hen lays an egg of a different size! What symmetry can there be on the breakfast table? At least they should sort them in dozens at the shop!\u201d", "\u201cNever mind the eggs,\u201d said Japp impatiently. \u201cLet \u2019em lay \u2019em square if they like. Tell us where our customer went to when he left The Cedars\u2014that is, if you know!\u201d", "\u201c_Eh bien_, he went to his hiding-place. Ah, this Monsieur Davenheim, there may be some malformation in his grey cells, but they are of the first quality!\u201d", "Poirot gently collected every fragment of shell from his plate, placed them in the egg-cup, and reversed the empty egg-shell on top of them. This little operation concluded, he smiled on the neat effect, and then beamed affectionately on us both.", "\u201cCome, my friends, you are men of intelligence. Ask yourselves the question which I asked myself. \u2018If I were this man, where should _I_ hide?\u2019 Hastings, what do you say?\u201d", "\u201cWell,\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019m rather inclined to think I\u2019d not do a bolt at all. I\u2019d stay in London\u2014in the heart of things, travel by tubes and buses; ten to one I\u2019d never be recognized. There\u2019s safety in a crowd.\u201d", "\u201cI don\u2019t agree. Get clear away at once\u2014that\u2019s the only chance. I would have had plenty of time to prepare things beforehand. I\u2019d have a yacht waiting, with steam up, and I\u2019d be off to one of the most out-of-the-way corners of the world before the hue and cry began!\u201d", "\u201cYou are seeking Monsieur Davenheim in order to put him in prison, so you never dream of looking to see if he may not be already there!\u201d", "\u201cYou tell me Madame Davenheim is not a very intelligent woman. Nevertheless I think that if you took her to Bow Street and confronted her with the man Billy Kellett, she would recognize him! In spite of the fact that he has shaved his beard and moustache and those bushy eyebrows, and has cropped his hair close. A woman nearly always knows her husband, though the rest of the world may be deceived!\u201d", "\u201cDid I not tell you Davenheim was a clever man? He prepared his alibi long beforehand. He was not in Buenos Ayres last autumn\u2014he was creating the character of Billy Kellett, \u2018doing three months,\u2019 so that the police should have no suspicions when the time came. He was playing, remember, for a large fortune, as well as liberty. It was worth while doing the thing thoroughly. Only\u2014\u2014\u201d", "\u201c_Eh bien_, afterwards he had to wear a false beard and wig, had to _make up as himself_ again, and to sleep with a false beard is not easy\u2014it invites detection! He cannot risk continuing to share the chamber of madame his wife. You found out for me that for the last six months, or ever since his supposed return from Buenos Ayres, he and Mrs. Davenheim occupied separate rooms. Then I was sure! Everything fitted in. The gardener who fancied he saw his master going round to the side of the house was quite right. He went to the boathouse, donned his \u2018tramp\u2019 clothes, which you may be sure had been safely hidden from the eyes of his valet, dropped the others in the lake, and proceeded to carry out his plan by pawning the ring in an obvious manner, and then assaulting a policeman, getting himself safely into the haven of Bow Street, where nobody would ever dream of looking for him!\u201d", "The next day a registered letter lay beside Poirot\u2019s plate. He opened it, and a five-pound note fluttered out. My friend\u2019s brow puckered.", "\u201c_Ah, sacr\u00e9!_ But what shall I do with it? I have much remorse! _Ce pauvre Japp_! Ah, an idea! We will have a little dinner, we three! That consoles me. It was really too easy. I am ashamed. I, who would not rob a child\u2014_mille tonnerres! Mon ami_, what have you, that you laugh so heartily?\u201d", "Poirot and I had many friends and acquaintances of an informal nature. Amongst these was to be numbered Dr. Hawker, a near neighbour of ours, and a member of the medical profession. It was the genial doctor\u2019s habit to drop in sometimes of an evening and have a chat with Poirot, of whose genius he was an ardent admirer. The doctor himself, frank and unsuspicious to the last degree, admired the talents so far removed from his own.", "On one particular evening in early June, he arrived about half-past eight and settled down to a comfortable discussion on the cheery topic of the prevalence of arsenical poisoning in crimes. It must have been about a quarter of an hour later when the door of our sitting-room flew open, and a distracted female precipitated herself into the room.", "I recognized in our new visitor Dr. Hawker\u2019s housekeeper, Miss Rider. The doctor was a bachelor, and lived in a gloomy old house a few streets away. The usually placid Miss Rider was now in a state bordering on incoherence.", "\u201cIt was the telephone, doctor. I answered it\u2014and a voice spoke. \u2018Help,\u2019 it said. \u2018Doctor\u2014help. They\u2019ve killed me!\u2019 Then it sort of tailed away. \u2018Who\u2019s speaking?\u2019 I said. \u2018Who\u2019s speaking?\u2019 Then I got a reply, just a whisper, it seemed, \u2018Foscatine\u2019\u2014something like that\u2014\u2018Regent\u2019s Court.\u2019\u201d", "\u201cI attended him for some slight ailment a few weeks ago. An Italian, but he speaks English perfectly. Well, I must wish you good night, Monsieur Poirot, unless\u2014\u2014\u201d He hesitated.", "\u201cI perceive the thought in your mind,\u201d said Poirot, smiling. \u201cI shall be delighted to accompany you. Hastings, run down and get hold of a taxi.\u201d", "Taxis always make themselves sought for when one is particularly pressed for time, but I captured one at last, and we were soon bowling along in the direction of Regent\u2019s Park. Regent\u2019s Court was a new block of flats, situated just off St. John\u2019s Wood Road. They had only recently been built, and contained the latest service devices.", "There was no one in the hall. The doctor pressed the lift-bell impatiently, and when the lift arrived questioned the uniformed attendant sharply.", "\u201cFirst I\u2019ve heard of it. Mr. Graves\u2014that\u2019s Count Foscatini\u2019s man\u2014went out about half an hour ago, and he said nothing.\u201d", "He pulled back the iron door, and we stepped out on the landing. No. II was opposite to us. The doctor rang the bell. There was no reply, and we could hear no sound from within. The doctor rang again and again; we could hear the bell trilling within, but no sign of life rewarded us.", "\u201cCertainly. I received a telephone message from Count Foscatini stating that he had been attacked and was dying. You can understand that we must lose no time\u2014if we are not already too late.\u201d", "We passed first into a small square lounge hall. A door on the right of it was half open. The manager indicated it with a nod.", "Dr. Hawker led the way. We followed close on his heels. As we entered the room I gave a gasp. The round table in the centre bore the remains of a meal; three chairs were pushed back, as though their occupants had just risen. In the corner, to the right of the fire-place, was a big writing-table, and sitting at it was a man\u2014or what had been a man. His right hand still grasped the base of the telephone, but he had fallen forward, struck down by a terrific blow on the head from behind. The weapon was not far to seek. A marble statuette stood where it had been hurriedly put down, the base of it stained with blood.", "The doctor\u2019s examination did not take a minute. \u201cStone dead. Must have been almost instantaneous. I wonder he even managed to telephone. It will be better not to move him until the police arrive.\u201d", "On the manager\u2019s suggestion we searched the flat, but the result was a foregone conclusion. It was not likely that the murderers would be concealed there when all they had to do was to walk out.", "We came back to the dining-room. Poirot had not accompanied us in our tour. I found him studying the centre table with close attention. I joined him. It was a well-polished round mahogany table. A bowl of roses decorated the centre, and white lace mats reposed on the gleaming surface. There was a dish of fruit, but the three dessert plates were untouched. There were three coffee-cups with remains of coffee in them\u2014two black, one with milk. All three men had taken port, and the decanter, half-full, stood before the centre plate. One of the men had smoked a cigar, the other two cigarettes. A tortoiseshell-and-silver box, holding cigars and cigarettes, stood open upon the table.", "I enumerated all these facts to myself, but I was forced to admit that they did not shed any brilliant light on the situation. I wondered what Poirot saw in them to make him so intent. I asked him.", "\u201cThis is the service lift,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt runs to the kitchens at the top of the building. You order through this telephone, and the dishes are sent down in the lift, one course at a time. The dirty plates and dishes are sent up in the same manner. No domestic worries, you understand, and at the same time you avoid the wearying publicity of always dining in a restaurant.\u201d", "\u201cThen the plates and dishes that were used to-night are on high in the kitchen. You permit that I mount there?\u201d", "\u201cOh, certainly, if you like! Roberts, the lift man, will take you up and introduce you; but I\u2019m afraid you won\u2019t find anything that\u2019s of any use. They\u2019re handling hundreds of plates and dishes, and they\u2019ll be all lumped together.\u201d", "Poirot remained firm, however, and together we visited the kitchens and questioned the man who had taken the order from Flat II.", "\u201cThe order was given from the _\u00e0 la carte menu_\u2014for three,\u201d he explained. \u201cSoup julienne, filet de sole normande, tournedos of beef, and a rice souffl\u00e9. What time? Just about eight o\u2019clock, I should say. No, I\u2019m afraid the plates and dishes have been all washed up by now. Unfortunate. You were thinking of finger-prints, I suppose?\u201d", "\u201cNot exactly,\u201d said Poirot, with an enigmatical smile. \u201cI am more interested in Count Foscatini\u2019s appetite. Did he partake of every dish?\u201d", "\u201cYes; but of course I can\u2019t say how much of each he ate. The plates were all soiled, and the dishes empty\u2014that is to say, with the exception of the rice souffl\u00e9. There was a fair amount of that left.\u201d", "\u201cThe latter was undoubtedly an orderly gentleman. After imploring help and announcing his approaching demise, he carefully hung up the telephone receiver.\u201d", "We re-entered the flat to find the local inspector of police had arrived with two constables. He was inclined to resent our appearance, but Poirot calmed him with the mention of our Scotland Yard friend, Inspector Japp, and we were accorded a grudging permission to remain. It was a lucky thing we were, for we had not been back five minutes before an agitated middle-aged man came rushing into the room with every appearance of grief and agitation.", "On the previous morning, two gentlemen had called to see his master. They were Italians, and the elder of the two, a man of about forty, gave his name as Signor Ascanio. The younger was a well-dressed lad of about twenty-four.", "Count Foscatini was evidently prepared for their visit and immediately sent Graves out upon some trivial errand. Here the man paused and hesitated in his story. In the end, however, he admitted that, curious as to the purport of the interview, he had not obeyed immediately, but had lingered about endeavouring to hear something of what was going on.", "The conversation was carried on in so low a tone that he was not as successful as he had hoped; but he gathered enough to make it clear that some kind of monetary proposition was being discussed, and that the basis of it was a threat. The discussion was anything but amicable. In the end, Count Foscatini raised his voice slightly, and the listener heard these words clearly:", "\u201cI have no time to argue further now, gentlemen. If you will dine with me to-morrow night at eight o\u2019clock, we will resume the discussion.\u201d", "Afraid of being discovered listening, Graves had then hurried out to do his master\u2019s errand. This evening the two men had arrived punctually at eight. During dinner they had talked of indifferent matters\u2014politics, the weather, and the theatrical world. When Graves had placed the port upon the table and brought in the coffee his master told him that he might have the evening off.", "\u201cNo, sir; it wasn\u2019t. That\u2019s what made me think it must be some business of a very unusual kind that he was going to discuss with these gentlemen.\u201d", "That finished Graves\u2019s story. He had gone out about 8.30, and, meeting a friend, had accompanied him to the Metropolitan Music Hall in Edgware Road.", "Nobody had seen the two men leave, but the time of the murder was fixed clearly enough at 8.47. A small clock on the writing-table had been swept off by Foscatini\u2019s arm, and had stopped at that hour, which agreed with Miss Rider\u2019s telephone summons.", "The police surgeon had made his examination of the body, and it was now lying on the couch. I saw the face for the first time\u2014the olive complexion, the long nose, the luxuriant black moustache, and the full red lips drawn back from the dazzlingly white teeth. Not altogether a pleasant face.", "\u201cWell,\u201d said the inspector, refastening his notebook. \u201cThe case seems clear enough. The only difficulty will be to lay our hands on this Signor Ascanio. I suppose his address is not in the dead man\u2019s pocket-book by any chance?\u201d", "As Poirot had said, the late Foscatini was an orderly man. Neatly written in small, precise handwriting was the inscription, \u201cSignor Paolo Ascanio, Grosvenor Hotel.\u201d", "\u201cJust in time. Our fine gentleman was off to catch the boat train to the Continong. Well, gentlemen, that\u2019s about all we can do here. It\u2019s a bad business, but straightforward enough. One of these Italian vendetta things, as likely as not.\u201d", "\u201cWhat says the master detective, eh?\u201d asked Hawker, clapping him on the back. \u201cNothing to work your grey cells over this time.\u201d", "\u201cIt is to the curtains I refer. They were not drawn. A little odd, that. And then there was the coffee. It was very black coffee.\u201d", "\u201cVery black,\u201d repeated Poirot. \u201cIn conjunction with that let us remember that very little of the rice souffl\u00e9 was eaten, and we get\u2014what?\u201d", "\u201cI don\u2019t know what you are getting at, all the same,\u201d I confessed. \u201cYou don\u2019t suspect the manservant, do you? He might have been in with the gang, and put some dope in the coffee. I suppose they\u2019ll test his alibi?\u201d", "Signor Ascanio was arrested and charged with the murder of Count Foscatini. When arrested, he denied knowing the Count, and declared he had never been near Regent\u2019s Court either on the evening of the crime or on the previous morning. The younger man had disappeared entirely. Signor Ascanio had arrived alone at the Grosvenor Hotel from the Continent two days before the murder. All efforts to trace the second man failed.", "Ascanio, however, was not sent for trial. No less a personage than the Italian Ambassador himself came forward and testified at the police-court proceedings that Ascanio had been with him at the Embassy from eight till nine that evening. The prisoner was discharged. Naturally, a lot of people thought that the crime was a political one, and was being deliberately hushed up.", "Poirot had taken a keen interest in all these points. Nevertheless, I was somewhat surprised when he suddenly informed me one morning that he was expecting a visitor at eleven o\u2019clock, and that that visitor was none other than Ascanio himself.", "\u201cA man cannot be tried twice for murder, Hastings. Endeavour to have the common sense. Ah, that is our friend\u2019s ring.\u201d", "A few minutes later Signor Ascanio was ushered in\u2014a small, thin man with a secretive and furtive glance in his eyes. He remained standing, darting suspicious glances from one to the other of us.", "\u201cBe seated, signor. You received my note. I am determined to get to the bottom of this mystery. In some small measure you can aid me. Let us commence. You\u2014in company with a friend\u2014visited the late Count Foscatini on the morning of Tuesday the 9th\u2014\u2014\u201d", "\u201cExactly; and as I am not an imbecile, it is not with the gallows I threaten you\u2014but with publicity. Publicity! I see that you do not like the word. I had an idea that you would not. My little ideas, you know, they are very valuable to me. Come, signor, your only chance is to be frank with me. I do not ask to know whose indiscretions brought you to England. I know this much, you came for the especial purpose of seeing Count Foscatini.\u201d", "\u201cI have already noted the fact that his name does not appear in the _Almanach de Gotha_. Never mind, the title of count is often useful in the profession of blackmailing.\u201d", "\u201cI have employed my grey cells to some advantage. Come, Signor Ascanio, you visited the dead man on the Tuesday morning\u2014that is so, is it not?\u201d", "\u201cYes; but I never went there on the following evening. There was no need. I will tell you all. Certain information concerning a man of great position in Italy had come into this scoundrel\u2019s possession. He demanded a big sum of money in return for the papers. I came over to England to arrange the matter. I called upon him by appointment that morning. One of the young secretaries of the Embassy was with me. The Count was more reasonable than I had hoped, although even then the sum of money I paid him was a huge one.\u201d", "\u201cIn Italian notes of comparatively small denomination. I paid over the money then and there. He handed me the incriminating papers. I never saw him again.\u201d", "\u201cI can only think that some one must have deliberately impersonated me. I understand that no money was found in the flat.\u201d", "\u201cStrange,\u201d he murmured. \u201cWe all have the little grey cells. And so few of us know how to use them. Good morning, Signor Ascanio. I believe your story. It is very much as I had imagined. But I had to make sure.\u201d", "\u201cNever, never will you use the brains the good God has given you. Recall to yourself some words I uttered after leaving the flat that night. I referred to the window-curtains not being drawn. We are in the month of June. It is still light at eight o\u2019clock. The light is failing by half-past. _\u00c7a vous dit quelque chose?_ I perceive a struggling impression that you will arrive some day. Now let us continue. The coffee was, as I said, very black. Count Foscatini\u2019s teeth were magnificently white. Coffee stains the teeth. We reason from that that Count Foscatini did not drink any coffee. Yet there was coffee in all three cups. Why should anyone pretend Count Foscatini had drunk coffee when he had not done so?\u201d", "\u201cCome, I will help you. What evidence have we that Ascanio and his friend, or two men posing as them, ever came to the flat that night? Nobody saw them go in; nobody saw them go out. We have the evidence of one man and of a host of inanimate objects.\u201d", "\u201cI mean knives and forks and plates and empty dishes. Ah, but it was a clever idea! Graves is a thief and a scoundrel, but what a man of method! He overhears a portion of the conversation in the morning, enough to realize that Ascanio will be in awkward position to defend himself. The following evening, about eight o\u2019clock, he tells his master he is wanted at the telephone. Foscatini sits down, stretches out his hand to the telephone, and from behind Graves strikes him down with the marble figure. Then quickly to the service telephone\u2014dinner for three! It comes, he lays the table, dirties the plates, knives, and forks, etc. But he has to get rid of the food too. Not only is he a man of brain; he has a resolute and capacious stomach! But after eating three tournedos, the rice souffl\u00e9 is too much for him! He even smokes a cigar and two cigarettes to carry out the illusion. Ah, but it was magnificently thorough! Then, having moved on the hands of the clock to 8.47, he smashes it and stops it. The one thing he does not do is to draw the curtains. But if there had been a real dinner party the curtains would have been drawn as soon as the light began to fail. Then he hurries out, mentioning the guests to the lift man in passing. He hurries to a telephone box, and as near as possible to 8.47 rings up the doctor with his master\u2019s dying cry. So successful is his idea that no one ever inquires if a call was put through from Flat II at that time.\u201d", "\u201cNot even Hercule Poirot,\u201d said my friend, with a smile. \u201cI am about to inquire now. I had to prove my point to you first. But you will see, I shall be right; and then Japp, to whom I have already given a hint, will be able to arrest the respectable Graves. I wonder how much of the money he has spent.\u201d", "The problem presented to us by Miss Violet Marsh made rather a pleasant change from our usual routine work. Poirot had received a brisk and business-like note from the lady asking for an appointment, and he had replied asking her to call upon him at eleven o\u2019clock the following day.", "She arrived punctually\u2014a tall, handsome young woman, plainly but neatly dressed, with an assured and business-like manner. Clearly a young woman who meant to get on in the world. I am not a great admirer of the so-called New Woman myself, and, in spite of her good looks, I was not particularly prepossessed in her favour.", "\u201cMy business is of a somewhat unusual nature, Monsieur Poirot,\u201d she began, after she had accepted a chair. \u201cI had better begin at the beginning and tell you the whole story.\u201d", "\u201cI am an orphan. My father was one of two brothers, sons of a small yeoman farmer in Devonshire. The farm was a poor one, and the elder brother, Andrew, emigrated to Australia, where he did very well indeed, and by means of successful speculation in land became a very rich man. The younger brother, Roger (my father), had no leanings towards the agricultural life. He managed to educate himself a little, and obtained a post as a clerk with a small firm. He married slightly above him; my mother was the daughter of a poor artist. My father died when I was six years old. When I was fourteen, my mother followed him to the grave. My only living relation then was my Uncle Andrew, who had recently returned from Australia and bought a small place, Crabtree Manor, in his native county. He was exceedingly kind to his brother\u2019s orphan child, took me to live with him, and treated me in every way as though I was his own daughter.", "\u201cCrabtree Manor, in spite of its name, is really only an old farmhouse. Farming was in my uncle\u2019s blood, and he was intensely interested in various modern farming experiments. Although kindness itself to me, he had certain peculiar and deeply-rooted ideas as to the up-bringing of women. Himself a man of little or no education, though possessing remarkable shrewdness, he placed little value on what he called \u2018book knowledge.\u2019 He was especially opposed to the education of women. In his opinion, girls should learn practical housework and dairy-work, be useful about the home, and have as little to do with book learning as possible. He proposed to bring me up on these lines, to my bitter disappointment and annoyance. I rebelled frankly. I knew that I possessed a good brain, and had absolutely no talent for domestic duties. My uncle and I had many bitter arguments on the subject, for, though much attached to each other, we were both self-willed. I was lucky enough to win a scholarship, and up to a certain point was successful in getting my own way. The crisis arose when I resolved to go to Girton. I had a little money of my own, left me by my mother, and I was quite determined to make the best use of the gifts God had given me. I had one long, final argument with my uncle. He put the facts plainly before me. He had no other relations, and he had intended me to be his sole heiress. As I have told you, he was a very rich man. If I persisted in these \u2018new-fangled notions\u2019 of mine, however, I need look for nothing from him. I remained polite, but firm. I should always be deeply attached to him, I told him, but I must lead my own life. We parted on that note. \u2018You fancy your brains, my girl,\u2019 were his last words. \u2018I\u2019ve no book learning, but, for all that, I\u2019ll pit mine against yours any day. We\u2019ll see what we shall see.\u2019", "\u201cThat was nine years ago. I have stayed with him for a week-end occasionally, and our relations were perfectly amicable, though his views remained unaltered. He never referred to my having matriculated, nor to my B.Sc. For the last three years his health had been failing, and a month ago he died.", "\u201cI am now coming to the point of my visit. My uncle left a most extraordinary will. By its terms, Crabtree Manor and its contents are to be at my disposal for a year from his death\u2014\u2018during which time my clever niece may prove her wits,\u2019 the actual words run. At the end of that period, \u2018my wits having proved better than hers,\u2019 the house and all my uncle\u2019s large fortune pass to various charitable institutions.\u201d", "\u201cI do not look on it in that way. Uncle Andrew warned me fairly, and I chose my own path. Since I would not fall in with his wishes, he was at perfect liberty to leave his money to whom he pleased.\u201d", "\u201cNo; it was written on a printed will-form and witnessed by the man and his wife who live in the house and do for my uncle.\u201d", "\u201cIt bears that interpretation, certainly,\u201d said Poirot thoughtfully. \u201cSomewhere in this rambling old manor-house your uncle has concealed either a sum of money in notes or possibly a second will, and has given you a year in which to exercise your ingenuity to find it.\u201d", "\u201cExactly, Monsieur Poirot; and I am paying you the compliment of assuming that your ingenuity will be greater than mine.\u201d", "\u201cEh, eh! but that is very charming of you. My grey cells are at your disposal. You have made no search yourself?\u201d", "\u201cOnly a cursory one; but I have too much respect for my uncle\u2019s undoubted abilities to fancy that the task will be an easy one.\u201d", "\u201cMade three years ago. Dated March 25; and the time is given also\u201411 a.m.\u2014that is very suggestive. It narrows the field of search. Assuredly it is another will we have to seek for. A will made even half-an-hour later would upset this. _Eh bien_, mademoiselle, it is a problem charming and ingenious that you have presented to me here. I shall have all the pleasure in the world in solving it for you. Granted that your uncle was a man of ability, his grey cells cannot have been of the quality of Hercule Poirot\u2019s!\u201d", "\u201cFortunately, I have nothing of moment on hand at the minute. Hastings and I will go down to Crabtree Manor to-night. The man and wife who attended on your uncle are still there, I presume?\u201d", "The following morning saw us started on the hunt proper. We had arrived late the night before. Mr. and Mrs. Baker, having received a telegram from Miss Marsh, were expecting us. They were a pleasant couple, the man gnarled and pink-cheeked, like a shrivelled pippin, and his wife a woman of vast proportions and true Devonshire calm.", "Tired with our journey and the eight-mile drive from the station, we had retired at once to bed after a supper of roast chicken, apple pie, and Devonshire cream. We had now disposed of an excellent breakfast, and were sitting in a small panelled room which had been the late Mr. Marsh\u2019s study and living-room. A roll-top desk stuffed with papers, all neatly docketed, stood against the wall, and a big leather armchair showed plainly that it had been its owner\u2019s constant resting-place. A big chintz-covered settee ran along the opposite wall, and the deep low window seats were covered with the same faded chintz of an old-fashioned pattern.", "\u201c_Eh bien, mon ami_,\u201d said Poirot, lighting one of his tiny cigarettes, \u201cwe must map out our plan of campaign. Already I have made a rough survey of the house, but I am of opinion that any clue will be found in this room. We shall have to go through the documents in the desk with meticulous care. Naturally, I do not expect to find the will amongst them; but it is likely that some apparently innocent paper may conceal the clue to its hiding-place. But first we must have a little information. Ring the bell, I pray of you.\u201d", "I did so. While we were waiting for it to be answered, Poirot walked up and down, looking about him approvingly.", "\u201cA man of method this Mr. Marsh. See how neatly the packets of papers are docketed; then the key to each drawer has its ivory label\u2014so has the key of the china cabinet on the wall; and see with what precision the china within is arranged. It rejoices the heart. Nothing here offends the eye\u2014\u2014\u201d", "He came to an abrupt pause, as his eye was caught by the key of the desk itself, to which a dirty envelope was affixed. Poirot frowned at it and withdrew it from the lock. On it were scrawled the words: \u201cKey of Roll Top Desk,\u201d in a crabbed handwriting, quite unlike the neat superscriptions on the other keys.", "\u201cAn alien note,\u201d said Poirot, frowning. \u201cI could swear that here we have no longer the personality of Mr. Marsh. But who else has been in the house? Only Miss Marsh, and she, if I mistake not, is also a young lady of method and order.\u201d", "Baker departed, and in a few moments returned with Mrs. Baker, wiping her hands on her apron and beaming all over her face.", "\u201cUs don\u2019t want to see Miss Violet done out of what\u2019s hers,\u201d declared the woman. \u201cCruel hard \u2019twould be for hospitals to get it all.\u201d", "Poirot proceeded with his questions. Yes, Mr. and Mrs. Baker remembered perfectly witnessing the will. Baker had previously been sent into the neighbouring town to get two printed will-forms.", "\u201cYes, sir, for safety like, I suppose, in case he should spoil one\u2014and sure enough, so he did do. Us had signed one\u2014\u2014\u201d", "\u201cWhy, to be sure, I\u2019d just put the milk on for the cocoa at eleven. Don\u2019t ee remember? It had all boiled over on the stove when us got back to kitchen.\u201d", "\u201c\u2019Twould be about an hour later. Us had to go in again. \u2018I\u2019ve made a mistake,\u2019 says old master, \u2018had to tear the whole thing up. I\u2019ll trouble you to sign again,\u2019 and us did. And afterwards master give us a tidy sum of money each. \u2018I\u2019ve left you nothing in my will,\u2019 says he, \u2018but each year I live you\u2019ll have this to be a nest-egg when I\u2019m gone\u2019; and sure enough, so he did.\u201d", "I may have imagined it, but I fancied that a moment or two elapsed before Baker replied: \u201cYes, sir, it is.\u201d", "The woman explained that about two years and a half ago workmen had been in the house to do certain repairs. She was quite vague as to what the repairs were. Her view seemed to be that the whole thing was a fad of her master\u2019s and quite unnecessary. Part of the time the workmen had been in the study; but what they had done there she could not say, as her master had not let either of them into the room whilst the work was in progress. Unfortunately, they could not remember the name of the firm employed, beyond the fact that it was a Plymouth one.", "\u201cWe progress, Hastings,\u201d said Poirot, rubbing his hands as the Bakers left the room. \u201cClearly he made a second will and then had workmen from Plymouth in to make a suitable hiding-place. Instead of wasting time taking up the floor and tapping the walls, we will go to Plymouth.\u201d", "With a little trouble, we were able to get the information we wanted. After one or two essays, we found the firm employed by Mr. Marsh.", "Their employees had all been with them many years, and it was easy to find the two men who had worked under Mr. Marsh\u2019s orders. They remembered the job perfectly. Amongst various other minor jobs, they had taken up one of the bricks of the old-fashioned fireplace, made a cavity beneath, and so cut the brick that it was impossible to see the join. By pressing on the second brick from the end, the whole thing was raised. It had been quite a complicated piece of work, and the old gentleman had been very fussy about it. Our informant was a man called Coghan, a big, gaunt man with a grizzled moustache. He seemed an intelligent fellow.", "We returned to Crabtree Manor in high spirits, and, locking the study door, proceeded to put our newly acquired knowledge into effect. It was impossible to see any sign on the bricks, but when we pressed in the manner indicated, a deep cavity was at once disclosed.", "Eagerly Poirot plunged in his hand. Suddenly his face fell from complacent elation to consternation. All he held was a charred fragment of stiff paper. But for it, the cavity was empty.", "We examined the scrap of paper anxiously. Clearly it was a fragment of what we sought. A portion of Baker\u2019s signature remained, but no indication of what the terms of the will had been.", "\u201c_Pourquoi?_ Neither will makes any provision for them, and they are more likely to be kept on with Miss Marsh than if the place became the property of a hospital. How could it be to anyone\u2019s advantage to destroy the will? The hospitals benefit\u2014yes; but one cannot suspect institutions.\u201d", "\u201cThat may be,\u201d he admitted. \u201cOne of your more sensible observations, Hastings. Well, we can do no more here. We have done all that mortal man can do. We have successfully pitted our wits against the late Andrew Marsh\u2019s; but, unfortunately, his niece is no better off for our success.\u201d", "By driving to the station at once, we were just able to catch a train to London, though not the principal express. Poirot was sad and dissatisfied. For my part, I was tired and dozed in a corner. Suddenly, as we were just moving out of Taunton, Poirot uttered a piercing squeal.", "Before I knew where I was we were standing on the platform, bareheaded and minus our valises, whilst the train disappeared into the night. I was furious. But Poirot paid no attention.", "\u201cThe tradesmen\u2019s books\u2014I have left them entirely out of account! Yes, but where? Where? Never mind, I cannot be mistaken. We must return at once.\u201d", "Easier said than done. We managed to get a slow train to Exeter, and there Poirot hired a car. We arrived back at Crabtree Manor in the small hours of the morning. I pass over the bewilderment of the Bakers when we had at last aroused them. Paying no attention to anybody, Poirot strode at once to the study.", "Going straight to the desk, he drew out the key, and detached the envelope from it. I stared at him stupidly. How could he possibly hope to find a big will-form in that tiny envelope? With great care he cut open the envelope, laying it out flat. Then he lighted the fire and held the plain inside surface of the envelope to the flame. In a few minutes faint characters began to appear.", "I looked. There were just a few lines of faint writing stating briefly that he left everything to his niece, Violet Marsh. It was dated March 25, 12.30 p.m., and witnessed by Albert Pike, confectioner, and Jessie Pike, married woman.", "\u201cAs far as I know, there is no law against writing your will in a blend of disappearing and sympathetic ink. The intention of the testator is clear, and the beneficiary is his only living relation. But the cleverness of him! He foresaw every step that a searcher would take\u2014that I, miserable imbecile, took. He gets two will-forms, makes the servants sign twice, then sallies out with his will written on the inside of a dirty envelope and a fountain-pen containing his little ink mixture. On some excuse he gets the confectioner and his wife to sign their names under his own signature, then he ties it to the key of his desk and chuckles to himself. If his niece sees through his little ruse, she will have justified her choice of life and elaborate education, and be thoroughly welcome to his money.\u201d", "\u201cBut no, Hastings. It is _your_ wits that go astray. Miss Marsh proved the astuteness of her wits and the value of the higher education for women by at once putting the matter in _my_ hands. Always employ the expert. She has amply proved her right to the money.\u201d", "***** This file should be named 61262-0.txt or 61262-0.zip ***** This and all associated files of various formats will be found in: http://www.gutenberg.org/6/1/2/6/61262/", "Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without permission and without paying copyright royalties.
